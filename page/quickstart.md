Title: Yesod quick start guide

1. Follow the [haskell-lang get started guide](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started) to get the Stack build tool.
    * On POSIX systems, this is usually `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`
2. Create a new scaffolded site: `stack new my-project yesod-sqlite && cd my-project`
    * NOTE: Use `stack templates` to see other available Yesod scaffoldings.
3. Install the yesod command line tool: `stack install yesod-bin --install-ghc`
4. Build libraries: `stack build`
5. Launch devel server: `stack exec -- yesod devel`
6. View your Yesod site at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

NOTE: If you get an error message about `GHC_PACKAGE_PATH` at step (5), you
need to install a newer version of yesod-bin. Try running `stack build
yesod-bin-1.4.11` and rerunning `stack exec -- yesod devel`. Also, if you choose
the "mini" scaffolding, `yesod devel` will not work.

NOTE: If you are using the openSUSE operating system, you may need to change the
`host` key in `./config/settings.yml` from `_env:HOST:*4` to `*4`. Please see
[Issue 1517](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1517) for further
information.

### System libraries

Note that you will need the dev version of some system libraries to be
available for the above steps to work. For example, on Ubuntu, you may need to
run something like:

    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev

If you're using a database, you'll likely need to install the system libraries
to talk to it. Some Ubuntu examples are:

    sudo apt-get install -y libmysqlclient-dev
    sudo apt-get install -y libpq-dev
