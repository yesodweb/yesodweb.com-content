<p>I'm very pleased to announce the release of Yesod 0.4.0. This release includes new major versions for WAI, Hamlet, persistent and web-routes-quasi, pulling in a large number of new features. As an introduction to this release, <a href="http://docs.yesodweb.com/yesod/screencast/blog-part1.html">I've begun a multi-part screencast of a blog tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>The major feature in this release is widgets. This allows you to create modular pieces of HTML/CSS/JavaScript and plug them together with ease. As an example, the widgets tutorial demonstrates having a jQuery UI datepicker and Nic HTML editor without explicitly calling any Javascript.</p>
<p>Other major changes: include a large architectural overhaul of persistent, which does not affect user code very much, but gives much more flexibility in using the library; an updated parser for Hamlet allowing some nice features like quoted attributes; a more sane subsite syntax hopefully allowing interoperation with other frameworks; and much more.</p>
<p>I keep the changelogs separate by project, you can see each of them here:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://docs.yesodweb.com/yesod/changelog.html">Yesod</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.yesodweb.com/hamlet/changelog.html">Hamlet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.yesodweb.com/persistent/changelog.html">Persistent</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.yesodweb.com/web-routes-quasi/changelog.html">web-routes-quasi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other releases, I don't have any major features planned next, so I'm very interested in what the community has to say at this point. I'm hoping to get a few more WAI backends working soon (waiting on some feedback from Snap before releasing a Snap-powered handler), but otherwise I'm open to suggestions.</p>
