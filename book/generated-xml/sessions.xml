<title>Sessions</title>
<simpara>HTTP is a stateless protocol. While some view this as a disadvantage, advocates
of RESTful web development laud this as a plus. When state is removed from the
picture, we get some automatic benefits, such as easier scalability and
caching.  You can draw many parallels with the non-mutable nature of Haskell in
general.</simpara>
<simpara>As much as possible, RESTful applications should avoid storing state about an
interaction with a client. However, it is sometimes unavoidable. Features like
shopping carts are the classic example, but other more mundane interactions
like proper login handling can be greatly enhanced by proper usage of sessions.</simpara>
<simpara>This chapter will describe how Yesod stores session data, how you can access
this data, and some special functions to help you make the most of sessions.</simpara>
<section id="sessions_clientsession">
<title>Clientsession</title>
<simpara>One of the earliest packages spun off from Yesod was clientsession. This
package uses encryption and signatures to store data in a client-side cookie.
The encryption prevents the user from inspecting the data, and the signature
ensures that the session can be neither hijacked nor tampered with.</simpara>
<simpara>It might sound like a bad idea from an efficiency standpoint to store data in a
cookie. After all, this means that the data must be sent on every request.
However, in practice, clientsession can be a great boon for performance.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
No server side database lookup is required to service a request.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
We can easily scale horizontally: each request contains all the information
  we need to send a response.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
To avoid undue bandwidth overhead, production sites can serve their static
  content from a separate domain name, thereby skipping transmission of the
  session cookie for each request.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Storing megabytes of information in the session will be a bad idea. But for
that matter, most session implementations recommend against such practices. If
you really need massive storage for a user, it is best to store a lookup key in
the session, and put the actual data in a database.</simpara>
<simpara>All of the interaction with clientsession is handled by Yesod internally, but
there are a few spots where you can tweak the behavior just a bit.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="sessions_controlling_sessions">
<title>Controlling sessions</title>
<simpara>By default, your Yesod application will use clientsession for its session
storage, getting the encryption key from the client <literal>client-session-key.aes</literal>
and giving a session a two hour timeout. (Note: timeout is measured from the
last time the client sent a request to the site, <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> from when then session
was first created.) However, all of those points can be modified by overriding
the <literal>makeSessionBackend</literal> method in the Yesod typeclass.</simpara>
<simpara>One simple way to override this method is to simply turn off session handling;
to do so, return <literal>Nothing</literal>. If your app has absolutely no session needs,
disabling them can give a bit of a performance increase. But be careful about
disabling sessions: this will also disable such features as Cross-Site Request
Forgery protection.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance Yesod App where
    makeSessionBackend _ = return Nothing</programlisting>
<simpara>Another common approach is to modify the filepath or timeout value, but
continue using client-session. To do so, use the <literal>defaultClientSessionBackend</literal>
helper function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance Yesod App where
    makeSessionBackend _ = do
        let minutes = 24 * 60 -- 1 day
            filepath = "mykey.aes"
        backend &lt;- defaultClientSessionBackend minutes filepath</programlisting>
<simpara>There are a few other functions to grant you more fine-grained control of
client-session, but they will rarely be necessary. Please see <literal>Yesod.Core</literal>'s
documentation if you are interested. It&#8217;s also possible to implement some other
form of session, such as a server side session. To my knowledge, at the time of
writing, no other such implementations exist.</simpara>
<note><simpara>If the given key file does not exist, it will be created and populated
with a randomly generated key. When you deploy your app to production, you
should include a pregenerated key with it, otherwise all existing sessions will
be invalidated when your new key file is generated. The scaffolding addresses
this for you.</simpara></note>

<title>Session Operations</title>
<simpara>Like most frameworks, a session in Yesod is a key-value store. The base session
API boils down to four functions: <literal>lookupSession</literal> gets a value for a key (if
available), <literal>getSession</literal> returns all of the key/value pairs, <literal>setSession</literal> sets
a value for a key, and <literal>deleteSession</literal> clears a value for a key.</simpara>

<section id="sessions_messages">
<title>Messages</title>
<simpara>One usage of sessions previously alluded to is messages. They come to solve a
common problem in web development: the user performs a <literal>POST</literal> request, the web
app makes a change, and then the web app wants to <emphasis>simultaneously</emphasis> redirect the
user to a new page and send the user a success message. (This is known as
Post/Redirect/Get.)</simpara>
<simpara>Yesod provides a pair of functions to enable this workflow: <literal>setMessage</literal> stores
a value in the session, and <literal>getMessage</literal> both reads the value most recently put
into the session, and clears the old value so it is not displayed twice.</simpara>
<simpara>It is recommended to have a call to <literal>getMessage</literal> in <literal>defaultLayout</literal> so that any
available message is shown to a user immediately, without having to add
<literal>getMessage</literal> calls to every handler.</simpara>

<section id="sessions_ultimate_destination">
<title>Ultimate Destination</title>
<simpara>Not to be confused with a horror film, ultimate destination is a technique
originally developed for Yesod&#8217;s authentication framework, but which has more
general usefulness.  Suppose a user requests a page that requires
authentication. If the user is not yet logged in, you need to send him/her to
the login page. A well-designed web app will then <emphasis>send them back to the first
page they requested</emphasis>. That&#8217;s what we call the ultimate destination.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>redirectUltDest</literal> sends the user to the ultimate destination set in his/her
session, clearing that value from the session. It takes a default destination
as well, in case there is no destination set. For setting the session, there
are three options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>setUltDest</literal> sets the destination to the given URL, which can be given
   either as a textual URL or a type-safe URL.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>setUltDestCurrent</literal> sets the destination to the currently requested URL.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>setUltDestReferer</literal> sets the destination based on the <literal>Referer</literal> header (the
   page that led the user to the current page).
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Additionally, there is the <literal>clearUltDest</literal> function, to drop the ultimate
destination value from the session if present.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at a small sample app. It will allow the user to set his/her name in
the session, and then tell the user his/her name from another route. If the
name hasn&#8217;t been set yet, the user will be redirected to the set name page,
with an ultimate destination set to come back to the current page.</simpara>

<title>Summary</title>
<simpara>Sessions are the primary means by which we bypass the statelessness imposed by
HTTP. We shouldn&#8217;t consider this an escape hatch to perform whatever actions we
want: statelessness in web applications is a virtue, and we should respect it
whenever possible. However, there are specific cases where it is vital to
retain some state.</simpara>
<simpara>The session API in Yesod is very simple. It provides a key-value store, and a
few convenience functions built on top for common use cases. If used properly,
with small payloads, sessions should be an unobtrusive part of your web
development.</simpara>
