<title>Haskell</title>
<simpara>Haskell is a powerful, fast, type-safe, functional programming language. This
book takes as an assumption that you are already familiar with most of the
basics of Haskell. There are two wonderful books for learning Haskell, both of
which are available for reading online:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<ulink url="http://learnyouahaskell.com">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</ulink>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<ulink url="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read">Real World Haskell</ulink>
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Additionally, there are a number of great articles on
<ulink url="https://tech.fpcomplete.com/haskell/learn/">FP Complete&#8217;s Haskell&#8217;s hub</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to use Yesod, you&#8217;re going to have to know at least the basics of
Haskell. Additionally, Yesod uses some features of Haskell that aren&#8217;t covered
in most introductory texts. While this book assumes the reader has a basic
familiarity with Haskell, this chapter is intended to fill in the gaps.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are already fluent in Haskell, feel free to completely skip this
chapter. Also, if you would prefer to start off by getting your feet wet with
Yesod, you can always come back to this chapter later as a reference.</simpara>
<section id="I_sect12_d1e423">
<title>Terminology</title>
<simpara>Even for those familiar with Haskell as a language, there can sometimes be some
confusion about terminology. Let&#8217;s establish some base terms that we can use
throughout this book.</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Data type
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
This is one of the core building blocks for a strongly typed
language like Haskell. Some data types, like <literal>Int</literal>, can be treated as primitive
values, while other data types will build on top of these to create more
complicated values. For example, you might represent a person with:
</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Person = Person Text Int</programlisting>
<simpara>Here, the <literal>Text</literal> would give the person&#8217;s name, and the <literal>Int</literal> would give the
person&#8217;s age. Due to its simplicity, this specific example type will recur
throughout the book. There are essentially three ways you can create a new data
type:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A <literal>type</literal> declaration such as <literal>type GearCount = Int</literal> merely creates a
  synonym for an existing type. The type system will do nothing to prevent
  you from using an <literal>Int</literal> where you asked for a <literal>GearCount</literal>. Using this can
  make your code more self-documenting.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A <literal>newtype</literal> declaration such as <literal>newtype Make = Make Text</literal>. In this case,
  you cannot accidentally use a <literal>Text</literal> in place of a <literal>Make</literal>; the compiler
  will stop you. The newtype wrapper always disappears during compilation,
  and will introduce no overhead.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A <literal>data</literal> declaration, such as <literal>Person</literal> above. You can also create
  Algebraic Data Types (ADTs), such as <literal>data Vehicle = Bicycle GearCount |
  Car Make Model</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Data constructor
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In our examples above, <literal>Person</literal>, <literal>Make</literal>, <literal>Bicycle</literal>, and
<literal>Car</literal> are all data constructors.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Type constructor
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In our examples above, <literal>Person</literal>, <literal>Make</literal>, and <literal>Vehicle</literal> are
all type constructors.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Type variables
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Consider the data type <literal>data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing</literal>. In
this case, <literal>a</literal> is a type variable.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<note><simpara>In both our <literal>Person</literal> and <literal>Make</literal> data types above, our data type and data
constructor both share the same name. This is a common practice when dealing
with a datatype with a single data constructor. However, there is nothing
requiring this be followed; you can always name the data types and data
constructors differently.</simpara></note>

<title>Tools</title>
<simpara>Since July 2015, the tooling recommendation for Yesod has become very simple:
use <ulink url="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack#readme">stack</ulink>. stack is a
complete build tool for Haskell which deals with your compiler (Glasgow Haskell
Compiler, aka GHC), libraries (including Yesod), additional build tools (like
alex and happy), and much more. There are other build tools available in
Haskell, and most of them support Yesod quite well. But for the easiest
experience, it&#8217;s strongly recommended to stick with stack.  The Yesod website
keeps an up-to-date <ulink url="http://www.yesodweb.com/page/quickstart">quick start
guide</ulink>, which provides instructions on installing stack and getting started
with a new scaffolded site.</simpara>
<simpara>Once you have your toolchain set up correctly, you&#8217;ll need to install a number
of Haskell libraries. For the vast majority of the book, the following command
will install all the libraries you need:</simpara>
<programlisting language="shell" linenumbering="unnumbered">stack build classy-prelude-yesod persistent-sqlite</programlisting>
<simpara>In order to run an example from the book, save it in a file, e.g.,
yesod-example.hs, and then run it with:</simpara>
<programlisting language="shell" linenumbering="unnumbered">stack runghc yesod-example.hs</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="I_sect12_d1e628">
<title>Language Pragmas</title>
<simpara>GHC will run by default in something very close to Haskell98 mode. It also
ships with a large number of language extensions, allowing more powerful type
classes, syntax changes, and more. There are multiple ways to tell GHC to turn
on these extensions. For most of the code snippets in this book, you&#8217;ll see
language pragmas, which look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE MyLanguageExtension #-}</programlisting>
<simpara>These should always appear at the top of your source file. Additionally, there
are two other common approaches:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
On the GHC command line, pass an extra argument <literal>-XMyLanguageExtension</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In your <literal>cabal</literal> file, add an <literal>default-extensions</literal> block.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>I personally never use the GHC command line argument approach. It&#8217;s a personal
preference, but I like to have my settings clearly stated in a file. In general,
it&#8217;s recommended to avoid putting extensions in your <literal>cabal</literal> file; however,
this rule mostly applies when writing publicly available libraries. When you&#8217;re
writing an application that you and your team will be working on, having all of
your language extensions defined in a single location makes a lot of sense.
The Yesod scaffolded site specifically uses this approach to avoid the
boilerplate of specifying the same language pragmas in every source file.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll end up using quite a few language extensions in this book (at the time of
writing, the scaffolding uses 13). We will not cover the meaning of all of
them. Instead, please see the
<ulink url="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/">GHC
documentation</ulink>.</simpara>

<section id="I_sect12_d1e671">
<title>Overloaded Strings</title>
<simpara>What&#8217;s the type of <literal>"hello"</literal>? Traditionally, it&#8217;s <literal>String</literal>, which is defined as
<literal>type String = [Char]</literal>. Unfortunately, there are a number of limitations with
this:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
It&#8217;s a very inefficient implementation of textual data. We need to allocate
  extra memory for each cons cell, plus the characters themselves each take up
  a full machine word.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Sometimes we have string-like data that&#8217;s not actually text, such as
  <literal>ByteString</literal>s and HTML.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>To work around these limitations, GHC has a language extension called
<literal>OverloadedStrings</literal>. When enabled, literal strings no longer have the
monomorphic type <literal>String</literal>; instead, they have the type <literal>IsString a &#8658; a</literal>,
where <literal>IsString</literal> is defined as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">class IsString a where
    fromString :: String -&gt; a</programlisting>
<simpara>There are <literal>IsString</literal> instances available for a number of types in Haskell, such
as <literal>Text</literal> (a much more efficient packed <literal>String</literal> type), <literal>ByteString</literal>, and
<literal>Html</literal>. Virtually every example in this book will assume that this language
extension is turned on.</simpara>
<simpara>Unfortunately, there is one drawback to this extension: it can sometimes
confuse GHC&#8217;s type checker. Imagine we have:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings, TypeSynonymInstances, FlexibleInstances #-}
import Data.Text (Text)

class DoSomething a where
    something :: a -&gt; IO ()

instance DoSomething String where
    something _ = putStrLn "String"

instance DoSomething Text where
    something _ = putStrLn "Text"

myFunc :: IO ()
myFunc = something "hello"</programlisting>
<simpara>Will the program print out <literal>String</literal> or <literal>Text</literal>? It&#8217;s not clear. So instead,
you&#8217;ll need to give an explicit type annotation to specify whether <literal>"hello"</literal>
should be treated as a <literal>String</literal> or <literal>Text</literal>.</simpara>
<note><simpara>In some cases, you can overcome these problems by using the
<literal>ExtendedDefaultRules</literal> language extension, though we&#8217;ll instead try to be
explicit in the book and not rely on defaults.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="I_sect12_d1e753">
<title>Type Families</title>
<simpara>The basic idea of a type family is to state some association between two
different types. Suppose we want to write a function that will safely take the
first element of a list. But we don&#8217;t want it to work just on lists; we&#8217;d like
it to treat a <literal>ByteString</literal> like a list of <literal>Word8</literal>s. To do so, we need to
introduce some associated type to specify what the contents of a certain type
are.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies, OverloadedStrings #-}
import Data.Word (Word8)
import qualified Data.ByteString as S
import Data.ByteString.Char8 () -- get an orphan IsString instance

class SafeHead a where
    type Content a
    safeHead :: a -&gt; Maybe (Content a)

instance SafeHead [a] where
    type Content [a] = a
    safeHead [] = Nothing
    safeHead (x:_) = Just x

instance SafeHead S.ByteString where
    type Content S.ByteString = Word8
    safeHead bs
        | S.null bs = Nothing
        | otherwise = Just $ S.head bs

main :: IO ()
main = do
    print $ safeHead ("" :: String)
    print $ safeHead ("hello" :: String)

    print $ safeHead ("" :: S.ByteString)
    print $ safeHead ("hello" :: S.ByteString)</programlisting>
<simpara>The new syntax is the ability to place a <literal>type</literal> inside of a <literal>class</literal> and
<literal>instance</literal>. We can also use <literal>data</literal> instead, which will create a new datatype
instead of reference an existing one.</simpara>
<note><simpara>There are other ways to use associated types outside the context of a typeclass. For more information on type families, see <ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Type_families">the Haskell wiki page</ulink>.</simpara></note>

<section id="I_sect12_d1e789">
<title>Template Haskell</title>
<simpara>Template Haskell (TH) is an approach to <emphasis>code generation</emphasis>. We use it in Yesod
in a number of places to reduce boilerplate, and to ensure that the generated
code is correct. Template Haskell is essentially Haskell which generates a
Haskell Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).</simpara>
<note><simpara>There&#8217;s actually more power in TH than that, as it can actually
introspect code. We don&#8217;t use these facilities in Yesod, however.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Writing TH code can be tricky, and unfortunately there isn&#8217;t very much type
safety involved. You can easily write TH that will generate code that won&#8217;t
compile. This is only an issue for the developers of Yesod, not for its users.
During development, we use a large collection of unit tests to ensure that the
generated code is correct. As a user, all you need to do is call these already
existing functions. For example, to include an externally defined Hamlet
template, you can write:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">$(hamletFile "myfile.hamlet")</programlisting>
<simpara>(Hamlet is discussed in the Shakespeare chapter.) The dollar sign immediately
followed by parentheses tell GHC that what follows is a Template Haskell
function. The code inside is then run by the compiler and generates a Haskell
AST, which is then compiled. And yes, it&#8217;s even possible to
<ulink url="http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2010/09/yo-dawg-template-haskell">go meta
with this</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>A nice trick is that TH code is allowed to perform arbitrary <literal>IO</literal> actions, and
therefore we can place some input in external files and have it parsed at
compile time. One example usage is to have compile-time checked HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript templates.</simpara>
<simpara>If your Template Haskell code is being used to generate declarations, and is
being placed at the top level of our file, we can leave off the dollar sign and
parentheses. In other words:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

-- Normal function declaration, nothing special
myFunction = ...

-- Include some TH code
$(myThCode)

-- Or equivalently
myThCode</programlisting>
<simpara>It can be useful to see what code is being generated by Template Haskell for
you. To do so, you should use the <literal>-ddump-splices</literal> GHC option.</simpara>
<note><simpara>There are many other features of Template Haskell not covered here. For
more information, see the
<ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Template_Haskell">Haskell wiki page</ulink>.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Template Haskell introduces something called the stage
restriction, which essentially means that code before a Template Haskell splice
cannot refer to code in the Template Haskell, or what follows. This will
sometimes require you to rearrange your code a bit. The same restriction
applies to QuasiQuotes.</simpara>
<simpara>While out of the box, Yesod is really geared for using code generation to avoid
boilerplate, it&#8217;s perfectly acceptable to use Yesod in a Template Haskell-free
way. There&#8217;s more information on that in the "Yesod for Haskellers" chapter.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="I_sect12_d1e833">
<title>QuasiQuotes</title>
<simpara>QuasiQuotes (QQ) are a minor extension of Template Haskell that let us embed
arbitrary content within our Haskell source files. For example, we mentioned
previously the <literal>hamletFile</literal> TH function, which reads the template contents from
an external file. We also have a quasi-quoter named <literal>hamlet</literal> that takes the
content inline:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}

[hamlet|&lt;p&gt;This is quasi-quoted Hamlet.|]</programlisting>
<simpara>The syntax is set off using square brackets and pipes. The name of the
quasi-quoter is given between the opening bracket and the first pipe, and the
content is given between the pipes.</simpara>
<simpara>Throughout the book, we will often times use the QQ-approach over a TH-powered
external file since the former is simpler to copy-and-paste. However, in
production, external files are recommended for all but the shortest of inputs
as it gives a nice separation of the non-Haskell syntax from your Haskell code.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="I_sect12_d1e851">
<title>API Documentation</title>
<simpara>The standard API documentation program in Haskell is called Haddock. The
standard Haddock search tool is called Hoogle. My recommendation is to use
<ulink url="https://www.stackage.org/">Stackage&#8217;s Hoogle search</ulink> and its
accompanying Haddocks for searching and browsing documentation. The reason for
this is that the Stackage Hoogle database covers a very large number of open
source Haskell packages, and the documentation provided is always fully
generated and known to link to other working Haddocks.</simpara>
<simpara>If when reading this book you run into types or functions that you do not
understand, try doing a Hoogle search with Hoogle to get more
information.</simpara>

<title>Summary</title>
<simpara>You don&#8217;t need to be an expert in Haskell to use Yesod, a basic familiarity
will suffice. This chapter hopefully gave you just enough extra information to
feel more comfortable following the rest of the book.</simpara>
