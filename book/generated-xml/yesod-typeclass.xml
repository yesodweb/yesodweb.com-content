<title>Yesod Typeclass</title>
<simpara>Every one of our Yesod applications requires an instance of the <literal>Yesod</literal>
typeclass. So far, we&#8217;ve only seen <literal>defaultLayout</literal>. In this chapter, we&#8217;ll
explore the meaning of many of the methods of the <literal>Yesod</literal> typeclass.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Yesod</literal> typeclass gives us a central place for defining settings for our
application. Everything has a default definition which is often the
right thing. But in order to build a powerful, customized application, you&#8217;ll
usually end up wanting to override at least a few of these methods.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>A common question we get is, "Why use a typeclass instead of a record type?" There are two main advantages:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The methods of the Yesod type class may wish to call other methods. With type
  classes, this kind of usage is trivial. It becomes slightly more complicated
  with a record type.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Simplicity of syntax. We want to provide default implementations and allow
  users to override just the necessary functionality. Type classes make this
  both easy and syntactically nice. Records have a slightly larger overhead.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section id="yesod-typeclass_rendering_and_parsing_urls">
<title>Rendering and Parsing URLs</title>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve already mentioned how Yesod is able to automatically render type-safe
URLs into a textual URL that can be inserted into an HTML page. Let&#8217;s say we
have a route definition that looks like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">mkYesod "MyApp" [parseRoutes|
/some/path SomePathR GET
]</programlisting>
<simpara>If we place <literal>SomePathR</literal> into a hamlet template, how does Yesod render it? Yesod
always tries to construct <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> URLs. This is especially useful once we
start creating XML sitemaps and Atom feeds, or sending emails. But in order to
construct an absolute URL, we need to know the domain name of the application.</simpara>
<simpara>You might think we could get that information from the user&#8217;s request, but we
still need to deal with ports. And even if we get the port number from the
request, are we using HTTP or HTTPS? And even if you know <emphasis>that</emphasis>, such an
approach would mean that, depending on how the user submitted a request would
generate different URLs. For example, we would generate different URLs
depending if the user connected to "example.com" or "www.example.com". For
Search Engine Optimization, we want to be able to consolidate on a single
canonical URL.</simpara>
<simpara>And finally, Yesod doesn&#8217;t make any assumption about <emphasis>where</emphasis> you host your
application. For example, I may have a mostly static site
(<ulink url="http://static.example.com/">http://static.example.com/</ulink>), but I&#8217;d like to stick a Yesod-powered Wiki at
/wiki/. There is no reliable way for an application to determine what subpath
it is being hosted from. So instead of doing all of this guesswork, Yesod needs
you to tell it the application root.</simpara>
<simpara>Using the wiki example, you would write your <literal>Yesod</literal> instance as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance Yesod MyWiki where
    approot = ApprootStatic "http://static.example.com/wiki"</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice that there is no trailing slash there. Next, when Yesod wants to
construct a URL for <literal>SomePathR</literal>, it determines that the relative path for
<literal>SomePathR</literal> is <literal>/some/path</literal>, appends that to your approot and creates
<literal>http://static.example.com/wiki/some/path</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The default value of <literal>approot</literal> is <literal>ApprootRelative</literal>, which essentially means
&#8220;don&#8217;t add any prefix.&#8221; In that case, the generated URL would be
<literal>/some/path</literal>. This works fine for the common case of a link within your
application, and your application being hosted at the root of your domain. But
if you have any use cases which demand absolute URLs (such as sending an
email), it&#8217;s best to use <literal>ApprootStatic</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>As is usually the case for commonly needed tweaks, the scaffolded site already
takes this into account. If you use the scaffolding, you can modify the approot
value from a config file.</simpara>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_joinpath">
<title>joinPath</title>
<simpara>In order to convert a type-safe URL into a text value, Yesod uses two helper
functions. The first is the <literal>renderRoute</literal> method of the <literal>RenderRoute</literal>
typeclass. Every type-safe URL is an instance of this typeclass. <literal>renderRoute</literal>
converts a value into a list of path pieces. For example, our <literal>SomePathR</literal> from
above would be converted into <literal>["some", "path"]</literal>.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Actually, <literal>renderRoute</literal> produces both the path pieces and a list of
query-string parameters. The default instances of <literal>renderRoute</literal> always provide
an empty list of query string parameters. However, it is possible to override
this. One notable case is the static subsite, which puts a hash of the file
contents in the query string for caching purposes.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The other function is the <literal>joinPath</literal> method of the Yesod typeclass. This function takes four arguments:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The foundation value
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The application root
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A list of path segments
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A list of query string parameters
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>It returns a textual URL. The default implementation does the &#8220;right thing&#8221;:
it separates the path pieces by forward slashes, prepends the application root,
and appends the query string.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are happy with default URL rendering, you should not need to modify it.
However, if you want to modify URL rendering to do things like append a
trailing slash, this would be the place to do it.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_cleanpath">
<title>cleanPath</title>
<simpara>The flip side of <literal>joinPath</literal> is <literal>cleanPath</literal>. Let&#8217;s look at how it gets used in
the dispatch process:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
The path info requested by the user is split into a series of path pieces.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
We pass the path pieces to the <literal>cleanPath</literal> function.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If <literal>cleanPath</literal> indicates a redirect (a <literal>Left</literal> response), then a 301 response
is sent to the client. This is used to force canonical URLs (eg, remove extra
slashes).
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Otherwise, we try to dispatch using the response from <literal>cleanPath</literal> (a
<literal>Right</literal>). If this works, we return a response. Otherwise, we return a 404.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>This combination allows subsites to retain full control of how their URLs
appear, yet allows master sites to have modified URLs. As a simple example,
let&#8217;s see how we could modify Yesod to always produce trailing slashes on URLs:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

import qualified Data.Text.Encoding                 as TE
import           Network.HTTP.Types                 (encodePath)
import           Yesod

data Slash = Slash

mkYesod "Slash" [parseRoutes|
/ RootR GET
/foo FooR GET
|]

instance Yesod Slash where
    joinPath _ ar pieces' qs' =
        fromText ar `mappend` encodePath pieces qs
      where
        qs = map (TE.encodeUtf8 *** go) qs'
        go "" = Nothing
        go x = Just $ TE.encodeUtf8 x
        pieces = pieces' ++ [""]

    -- We want to keep canonical URLs. Therefore, if the URL is missing a
    -- trailing slash, redirect. But the empty set of pieces always stays the
    -- same.
    cleanPath _ [] = Right []
    cleanPath _ s
        | dropWhile (not . T.null) s == [""] = -- the only empty string is the last one
            Right $ init s
        -- Since joinPath will append the missing trailing slash, we simply
        -- remove empty pieces.
        | otherwise = Left $ filter (not . T.null) s

getRootR :: Handler Html
getRootR = defaultLayout
    [whamlet|
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=@{RootR}&gt;RootR
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=@{FooR}&gt;FooR
    |]

getFooR :: Handler Html
getFooR = getRootR

main :: IO ()
main = warp 3000 Slash</programlisting>
<simpara>First, let&#8217;s look at our <literal>joinPath</literal> implementation. This is copied almost
verbatim from the default Yesod implementation, with one difference: we append
an extra empty string to the end. When dealing with path pieces, an empty
string will append another slash. So adding an extra empty string will force a
trailing slash.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>cleanPath</literal> is a little bit trickier. First, we check for the empty path like
before, and if so pass it through as-is. We use Right to indicate that a
redirect is not necessary. The next clause is actually checking for two
different possible URL issues:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
There is a double slash, which would show up as an empty string in the middle
  of our paths.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
There is a missing trailing slash, which would show up as the last piece not
  being an empty string.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Assuming neither of those conditions hold, then only the last piece is empty,
and we should dispatch based on all but the last piece. However, if this is not
the case, we want to redirect to a canonical URL. In this case, we strip out
all empty pieces and do not bother appending a trailing slash, since <literal>joinPath</literal>
will do that for us.</simpara>

<section id="yesod-typeclass_defaultlayout">
<title>defaultLayout</title>
<simpara>Most websites like to apply some general template to all of their pages.
<literal>defaultLayout</literal> is the recommended approach for this. While you could just as
easily define your own function and call that instead, when you override
<literal>defaultLayout</literal> all of the Yesod-generated pages (error pages, authentication
pages) automatically get this style.</simpara>
<simpara>Overriding is very straight-forward: we use <literal>widgetToPageContent</literal> to convert a
<literal>Widget</literal> to a title, head tags and body tags, and then use <literal>giveUrlRenderer</literal> to
convert a Hamlet template into an <literal>Html</literal> value. We can even add extra widget
components, like a Lucius template, from within <literal>defaultLayout</literal>. For more
information, see the previous chapter on widgets.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are using the scaffolded site, you can modify the files
<literal>templates/default-layout.hamlet</literal> and
<literal>templates/default-layout-wrapper.hamlet</literal>.</simpara>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_getmessage">
<title>getMessage</title>
<simpara>Even though we haven&#8217;t covered sessions yet, I&#8217;d like to mention <literal>getMessage</literal>
here. A common pattern in web development is setting a message in one handler
and displaying it in another. For example, if a user <literal>POST</literal>s a form, you may
want to redirect him/her to another page along with a &#8220;Form submission
complete&#8221; message. This is commonly known as
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get">Post/Redirect/Get</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>To facilitate this, Yesod comes built in with a pair of functions: <literal>setMessage</literal>
sets a message in the user session, and <literal>getMessage</literal> retrieves the message (and
clears it, so it doesn&#8217;t appear a second time). It&#8217;s recommended that you put
the result of <literal>getMessage</literal> into your <literal>defaultLayout</literal>. For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes           #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell       #-}

import           Yesod
import Data.Time (getCurrentTime)

data App = App

mkYesod "App" [parseRoutes|

instance Yesod App where
    defaultLayout contents = do
        PageContent title headTags bodyTags &lt;- widgetToPageContent contents
        mmsg &lt;- getMessage
        giveUrlRenderer [hamlet|
            $doctype 5

            &lt;html&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                    &lt;title&gt;#{title}
                    ^{headTags}
                &lt;body&gt;
                    $maybe msg &lt;- mmsg
                        &lt;div #message&gt;#{msg}
                    ^{bodyTags}
        |]

getHomeR :: Handler Html
getHomeR = do
    now &lt;- liftIO getCurrentTime
    setMessage $ toHtml $ "You previously visited at: " ++ show now
    defaultLayout [whamlet|&lt;p&gt;Try refreshing|]

main :: IO ()
main = warp 3000 App</programlisting>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll cover <literal>getMessage</literal>/<literal>setMessage</literal> in more detail when we discuss sessions.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_custom_error_pages">
<title>Custom error pages</title>
<simpara>One of the marks of a professional web site is a properly designed error page.
Yesod gets you a long way there by automatically using your <literal>defaultLayout</literal> for
displaying error pages. But sometimes, you&#8217;ll want to go even further. For
this, you&#8217;ll want to override the <literal>errorHandler</literal> method:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes           #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell       #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies          #-}
import           Yesod

data App = App

mkYesod "App" [parseRoutes|
/ HomeR GET
/error ErrorR GET
/not-found NotFoundR GET
|]

instance Yesod App where
    errorHandler NotFound = fmap toTypedContent $ defaultLayout $ do
        setTitle "Request page not located"
        toWidget [hamlet|
&lt;h1&gt;Not Found
&lt;p&gt;We apologize for the inconvenience, but the requested page could not be located.
|]
    errorHandler other = defaultErrorHandler other

getHomeR :: Handler Html
getHomeR = defaultLayout
    [whamlet|
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;a href=@{ErrorR}&gt;Internal server error
            &lt;a href=@{NotFoundR}&gt;Not found
    |]

getErrorR :: Handler ()
getErrorR = error "This is an error"

getNotFoundR :: Handler ()
getNotFoundR = notFound

main :: IO ()
main = warp 3000 App</programlisting>
<simpara>Here we specify a custom 404 error page. We can also use the
<literal>defaultErrorHandler</literal> when we don&#8217;t want to write a custom handler for each
error type. Due to type constraints, we need to start off our methods with
<literal>fmap toTypedContent</literal>, but otherwise you can write a typical handler function.
(We&#8217;ll learn more about <literal>TypedContent</literal> in the next chapter.)</simpara>
<simpara>In fact, you could even use special responses like redirects:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">    errorHandler NotFound = redirect HomeR
    errorHandler other = defaultErrorHandler other</programlisting>
<note><simpara>Even though you <emphasis>can</emphasis> do this, I don&#8217;t actually recommend such practices.
A 404 should be a 404.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_external_css_and_javascript">
<title>External CSS and Javascript</title>
<note><simpara>The functionality described here is automatically included in the scaffolded site, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about implementing this yourself.</simpara></note>
<simpara>One of the most powerful, and most intimidating, methods in the Yesod typeclass
is <literal>addStaticContent</literal>. Remember that a Widget consists of multiple components,
including CSS and Javascript. How exactly does that CSS/JS arrive in the user&#8217;s
browser? By default, they are served in the <literal>&lt;head&gt;</literal> of the page, inside
<literal>&lt;style&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal> tags, respectively.</simpara>
<simpara>That might be simple, but it&#8217;s far from efficient. Every page load will now
require loading up the CSS/JS from scratch, even if nothing changed! What we
really want is to store this content in an external file and then refer to it
from the HTML.</simpara>
<simpara>This is where <literal>addStaticContent</literal> comes in. It takes three arguments: the
filename extension of the content (<literal>css</literal> or <literal>js</literal>), the mime-type of the content
(<literal>text/css</literal> or <literal>text/javascript</literal>) and the content itself. It will then return
one of three possible results:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Nothing
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
No static file saving occurred; embed this content directly in the
HTML. This is the default behavior.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Just (Left Text)
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
This content was saved in an external file, and use the
given textual link to refer to it.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
Just (Right (Route a, Query))
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Same, but now use a type-safe URL along with
some query string parameters.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>The <literal>Left</literal> result is useful if you want to store your static files on an
external server, such as a CDN or memory-backed server. The <literal>Right</literal> result is
more commonly used, and ties in very well with the static subsite. This is the
recommended approach for most applications, and is provided by the scaffolded
site by default.</simpara>
<note><simpara>You might be wondering: if this is the recommended approach, why isn&#8217;t it
the default? The problem is that it makes a number of assumptions that don&#8217;t
universally hold: your application has a static subsite, and the location of
your static files.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The scaffolded <literal>addStaticContent</literal> does a number of intelligent things to help
you out:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
It automatically minifies your Javascript using the hjsmin package.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
It names the output files based on a hash of the file contents. This means
  you can set your cache headers to far in the future without fears of stale
  content.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Also, since filenames are based on hashes, you can be guaranteed that a file
  doesn&#8217;t need to be written if a file with the same name already exists. The
  scaffold code automatically checks for the existence of that file, and avoids
  the costly disk I/O of a write if it&#8217;s not necessary.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_smarter_static_files">
<title>Smarter Static Files</title>
<simpara>Google recommends an important optimization:
<ulink url="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/request.html#ServeFromCookielessDomain">serve
static files from a separate domain</ulink>. The advantage to this approach is that
cookies set on your main domain are not sent when retrieving static files, thus
saving on a bit of bandwidth.</simpara>
<simpara>To facilitate this, we have the <literal>urlRenderOverride</literal> method. This method
intercepts the normal URL rendering and sets a special value for some routes.
For example, the scaffolding defines this method as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">urlRenderOverride y (StaticR s) =
    Just $ uncurry (joinPath y (Settings.staticRoot $ settings y)) $ renderRoute s

urlRenderOverride _ _ = Nothing</programlisting>
<simpara>This means that static routes are served from a special static root, which you
can configure to be a different domain. This is a great example of the power
and flexibility of type-safe URLs: with a single line of code you&#8217;re able to
change the rendering of static routes throughout all of your handlers.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_authentication_authorization">
<title>Authentication/Authorization</title>
<simpara>For simple applications, checking permissions inside each handler function can
be a simple, convenient approach. However, it doesn&#8217;t scale well. Eventually,
you&#8217;re going to want to have a more declarative approach. Many systems out
there define ACLs, special config files, and a lot of other hocus-pocus. In
Yesod, it&#8217;s just plain old Haskell. There are three methods involved:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
isWriteRequest
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Determine if the current request is a "read" or "write" operations. By default, Yesod follows RESTful principles, and assumes <literal>GET</literal>, <literal>HEAD</literal>, <literal>OPTIONS</literal>, and <literal>TRACE</literal> requests are read-only, while all others are can write.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
isAuthorized
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Takes a route (i.e., type-safe URL) and a boolean indicating whether or not the request is a write request. It returns an <literal>AuthResult</literal>, which can have one of three values:
</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>Authorized</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>AuthenticationRequired</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>Unauthorized</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>By default, it returns <literal>Authorized</literal> for all requests.</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
authRoute
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If <literal>isAuthorized</literal> returns <literal>AuthenticationRequired</literal>, then redirect
to the given route. If no route is provided (the default), return a 401
&#8220;authentication required&#8221; message.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
<simpara>These methods tie in nicely with the yesod-auth package, which is used by the
scaffolded site to provide a number of authentication options, such as OpenID,
Mozilla Persona, email, username and Twitter. We&#8217;ll cover more concrete
examples in the auth chapter.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="yesod-typeclass_some_simple_settings">
<title>Some Simple Settings</title>
<simpara>Not everything in the Yesod typeclass is complicated. Some methods are simple
functions. Let&#8217;s just go through the list:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
maximumContentLength
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
To prevent Denial of Server (DoS) attacks, Yesod will
limit the size of request bodies. Some of the time, you&#8217;ll want to bump that
limit for some routes (e.g., a file upload page). This is where you&#8217;d do that.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
fileUpload
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Determines how uploaded files and treated, based on the size of
the request. The two most common approaches are saving the files in memory, or

<title>Summary</title>
<simpara>The Yesod typeclass has a number of overrideable methods that allow you to
configure your application. They are all optional, and provide sensible
defaults. By using built-in Yesod constructs like <literal>defaultLayout</literal> and
<literal>getMessage</literal>, you&#8217;ll get a consistent look-and-feel throughout your site,
including pages automatically generated by Yesod such as error pages and
authentication.</simpara>
<simpara>We haven&#8217;t covered all the methods in the Yesod typeclass in this chapter. For
a full listing of methods available, you should consult the Haddock
documentation.</simpara>
