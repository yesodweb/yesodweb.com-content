<title>Internationalization</title>
<simpara>Users expect our software to speak their language. Unfortunately for us, there
will likely be more than one language involved. While doing simple string
replacement isn&#8217;t too involved, correctly dealing with all the grammar issues
can be tricky. After all, who wants to see "List 1 file(s)" from a program
output?</simpara>
<simpara>But a real i18n solution needs to do more than just provide a means of
achieving the correct output. It needs to make this process easy for both the
programmer and the translator and relatively error-proof. Yesod&#8217;s answer to the
problem gives you:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>

<simpara>
Intelligent guessing of the user&#8217;s desired language based on request headers,
  with the ability to override.

<simpara>
A simple syntax for giving translations which requires no Haskell knowledge.
  (After all, most translators aren&#8217;t programmers.)
</simpara>

<simpara>
The ability to bring in the full power of Haskell for tricky grammar issues
  as necessary, along with a default selection of helper functions to cover
  most needs.

<section id="internationalization_overview">
<title>Overview</title>
<simpara>Most existing i18n solutions out there, like gettext or Java message bundles,
work on the principle of string lookups. Usually some form of
printf-interpolation is used to interpolate variables into the strings. In
Yesod, as you might guess, we instead rely on types. This gives us all of our
normal advantages, such as the compiler automatically catching mistakes.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take a concrete example. Suppose our application has two things it wants
to say to a user: say hello, and state how many users are logged into the
system. This can be modeled with a sum type:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data MyMessage = MsgHello | MsgUsersLoggedIn Int</programlisting>
<simpara>I can also write a function to turn this datatype into an English representation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">toEnglish :: MyMessage -&gt; String
toEnglish MsgHello = "Hello there!"
toEnglish (MsgUsersLoggedIn 1) = "There is 1 user logged in."
toEnglish (MsgUsersLoggedIn i) = "There are " ++ show i ++ " users logged in."</programlisting>
<simpara>We can also write similar functions for other languages. The advantage to this
inside-Haskell approach is that we have the full power of Haskell for
addressing tricky grammar issues, especially pluralization.</simpara>
<note><simpara>You may think pluralization isn&#8217;t so complicated: you have one version
for 1 item, and another for any other count. That might be true in English, but
it&#8217;s not true for every language. Russian, for example, has six different
forms, and you need to use some modulus logic to determine which one to use.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The downside, however, is that you have to write all of this inside of Haskell,
which won&#8217;t be very translator-friendly. To solve this, Yesod introduces the
concept of message files. We&#8217;ll cover that in a little bit.</simpara>
<simpara>Assuming we have this full set of translation functions, how do we go about
using them? What we need is a new function to wrap them all up together, and
then choose the appropriate translation function based on the user&#8217;s selected
language. Once we have that, Yesod can automatically choose the most relevant
render function and call it on the values you provide.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to simplify things a bit, Hamlet has a special interpolation syntax,
<literal>_{&#8230;}</literal>, which handles all the calls to the render functions. And in order to
associate a render function with your application, you use the <literal>YesodMessage</literal>
typeclass.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="internationalization_message_files">
<title>Message files</title>
<simpara>The simplest approach to creating translations is via message files. The setup
is simple: there is a single folder containing all of your translation files,
with a single file for each language. Each file is named based on its language
code, e.g. <emphasis>en.msg</emphasis>. And each line in a file handles one phrase, which
correlates to a single constructor in your message data type.</simpara>
<note><simpara>The scaffolded site already includes a fully configured message folder.</simpara></note>
<simpara>So firstly, a word about language codes. There are really two choices
available: using a two-letter language code, or a language-LOCALE code. For
example, when I load up a page in my web browser, it sends two language codes:
en-US and en. What my browser is saying is "if you have American English, I
like that the most. If you have English, I&#8217;ll take that instead."</simpara>
<simpara>So which format should you use in your application? Most likely two-letter
codes, unless you are actually creating separate translations by locale. This
ensures that someone asking for Canadian English will still see your English.
Behind the scenes, Yesod will add the two-letter codes where relevant. For
example, suppose a user has the following language list:</simpara>
<programlisting language="langs" linenumbering="unnumbered">pt-BR, es, he</programlisting>
<simpara>What this means is "I like Brazilian Porteguese, then Spanish, and then
Hebrew." Suppose your application provides the languages pt (general
Porteguese) and English, with English as the default. Strictly following the
user&#8217;s language list would result in the user being served English. Instead,
Yesod translates that list into:</simpara>
<programlisting language="langs" linenumbering="unnumbered">pt-BR, es, he, pt</programlisting>
<simpara>In other words: unless you&#8217;re giving different translations based on locale,
just stick to the two-letter language codes.</simpara>
<simpara>Now what about these message files? The syntax should be very familiar after
your work with Hamlet and Persistent. The line starts off with the name of the
message. Since this is a data constructor, it must start with a capital letter.
Next, you can have individual parameters, which must be given as lower case.
These will be arguments to the data constructor.</simpara>
<simpara>The argument list is terminated by a colon, and then followed by the translated
string, which allows usage of our typical variable interpolation syntax
translation helper functions to deal with issues like pluralization, you can
create all the translated messages you need.</simpara>
<section id="internationalization_specifying_types">
<title>Specifying types</title>
<simpara>Since we will be creating a datatype out of our message specifications, each
parameter to a data constructor must be given a data type. We use a @-syntax
for this. For example, to create the datatype <literal>data MyMessage = MsgHello |
MsgSayAge Int</literal>, we would write:</simpara>
<programlisting language="messages" linenumbering="unnumbered">Hello: Hi there!
SayAge age@Int: Your age is: #{show age}</programlisting>
<simpara>But there are two problems with this:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
It&#8217;s not very DRY (don&#8217;t repeat yourself) to have to specify this datatype in every file.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Translators will be confused having to specify these datatypes.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>So instead, the type specification is only required in the main language file.
This is specified as the third argument in the <literal>mkMessage</literal> function. This also
specifies what the backup language will be, to be used when none of the
languages provided by your application match the user&#8217;s language list.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="internationalization_rendermessage_typeclass">
<title>RenderMessage typeclass</title>
<simpara>Your call to <literal>mkMessage</literal> creates an instance of the <literal>RenderMessage</literal> typeclass,
which is the core of Yesod&#8217;s i18n. It is defined as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">class RenderMessage master message where
    renderMessage :: master
                  -&gt; [Text] -- ^ languages
                  -&gt; message
                  -&gt; Text</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice that there are two parameters to the <literal>RenderMessage</literal> class: the master
site and the message type. In theory, we could skip the master type here, but
that would mean that every site would need to have the same set of translations
for each message type. When it comes to shared libraries like forms, that would
not be a workable solution.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>renderMessage</literal> function takes a parameter for each of the class&#8217;s type
parameters: master and message. The extra parameter is a list of languages the
user will accept, in descending order of priority. The method then returns a
user-ready <literal>Text</literal> that can be displayed.</simpara>
<simpara>A simple instance of <literal>RenderMessage</literal> may involve no actual translation of
strings; instead, it will just display the same value for every language. For
example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data MyMessage = Hello | Greet Text
instance RenderMessage MyApp MyMessage where
    renderMessage _ _ Hello = "Hello"
    renderMessage _ _ (Greet name) = "Welcome, " &lt;&gt; name &lt;&gt; "!"</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice how we ignore the first two parameters to <literal>renderMessage</literal>. We can now
extend this to support multiple languages:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">renderEn Hello = "Hello"
renderEn (Greet name) = "Welcome, " &lt;&gt; name &lt;&gt; "!"
renderHe Hello = "שלום"
renderHe (Greet name) = "ברוכים הבאים, " &lt;&gt; name &lt;&gt; "!"
instance RenderMessage MyApp MyMessage where
    renderMessage _ ("en":_) = renderEn
    renderMessage _ ("he":_) = renderHe
    renderMessage master (_:langs) = renderMessage master langs
    renderMessage _ [] = renderEn</programlisting>
<simpara>The idea here is fairly straight-forward: we define helper functions to support
each language. We then add a clause to catch each of those languages in the
renderMessage definition. We then have two final cases: if no languages
matched, continue checking with the next language in the user&#8217;s priority list.
If we&#8217;ve exhausted all languages the user specified, then use the default
language (in our case, English).</simpara>
<simpara>But odds are that you will never need to worry about writing this stuff
manually, as the message file interface does all this for you. But it&#8217;s always
a good idea to have an understanding of what&#8217;s going on under the surface.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="internationalization_interpolation">
<title>Interpolation</title>
<simpara>One way to use your new <literal>RenderMessage</literal> instance would be to directly call the
<literal>renderMessage</literal> function. This would work, but it&#8217;s a bit tedious: you need to
pass in the foundation value and the language list manually. Instead, Hamlet
provides a specialized i18n interpolation, which looks like <literal>_{&#8230;}</literal>.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Why the underscore? Underscore is already a well-established character
for i18n, as it is used in the gettext library.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Hamlet will then automatically translate that to a call to <literal>renderMessage</literal>.
Once Hamlet gets the output <literal>Text</literal> value, it uses the <literal>toHtml</literal> function to
produce an <literal>Html</literal> value, meaning that any special characters (&lt;, &amp;,
&gt;) will be automatically escaped.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="internationalization_phrases_not_words">
<title>Phrases, not words</title>
<simpara>As a final note, I&#8217;d just like to give some general i18n advice. Let&#8217;s say you
have an application for selling turtles. You&#8217;re going to use the word "turtle"
in multiple places, like "You have added 4 turtles to your cart." and "You have
purchased 4 turtles, congratulations!" As a programmer, you&#8217;ll immediately
notice the code reuse potential: we have the phrase "4 turtles" twice. So you
might structure your message file as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="messages" linenumbering="unnumbered">AddStart: You have added
AddEnd: to your cart.
PurchaseStart: You have purchased
PurchaseEnd: , congratulations!
Turtles count@Int: #{show count} #{plural count "turtle" "turtles"}</programlisting>
<simpara>STOP RIGHT THERE! This is all well and good from a programming perspective, but translations are <emphasis>not</emphasis> programming. There are a many things that could go wrong with this, such as:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Some languages might put "to your cart" before "You have added."
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Maybe "added" will be constructed differently depending whether you added 1 or more turtles.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
There are a bunch of whitespace issues as well.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>So the general rule is: translate entire phrases, not just words.</simpara>
