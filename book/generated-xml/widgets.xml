<title>Widgets</title>
<simpara>One of the challenges in web development is that we have to coordinate three
different client-side technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript. Worse still, we
have to place these components in different locations on the page: CSS in a
style tag in the head, Javascript in a script tag in the head, and HTML in the
body. And never mind if you want to put your CSS and Javascript in separate
files!</simpara>
<simpara>In practice, this works out fairly nicely when building a single page, because
we can separate our structure (HTML), style (CSS) and logic (Javascript). But
when we want to build modular pieces of code that can be easily composed, it
can be a headache to coordinate all three pieces separately. Widgets are
Yesod&#8217;s solution to the problem. They also help with the issue of including
libraries, such as jQuery, one time only.</simpara>
<simpara>Our four template languages- Hamlet, Cassius, Lucius and Julius- provide the
raw tools for constructing your output. Widgets provide the glue that allows
them to work together seamlessly.</simpara>

<section id="widgets_what_8217_s_in_a_widget">
<title>What&#8217;s in a Widget?</title>
<simpara>At a very superficial level, an HTML document is just a bunch of nested tags.
This is the approach most HTML generation tools take: you define hierarchies of
tags and are done with it. But let&#8217;s imagine that I want to write a component
of a page for displaying the navbar. I want this to be "plug and play": I call
the function at the right time, and the navbar is inserted at the correct point
in the hierarchy.</simpara>
<simpara>This is where our superficial HTML generation breaks down. Our navbar likely
consists of some CSS and JavaScript in addition to HTML. By the time we call
the navbar function, we have already rendered the <literal>&lt;head&gt;</literal> tag, so it is too
late to add a new <literal>&lt;style&gt;</literal> tag for our CSS declarations. Under normal
strategies, we would need to break up our navbar function into three parts:
HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and make sure that we always call all three pieces.</simpara>
<simpara>Widgets take a different approach. Instead of viewing an HTML document as a
monolithic tree of tags, widgets see a number of distinct components in the
page. In particular:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The title
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
External stylesheets
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
External Javascript
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
CSS declarations
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Javascript code
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Arbitrary <literal>&lt;head&gt;</literal> content
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Arbitrary <literal>&lt;body&gt;</literal> content
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Different components have different semantics. For example, there can only be
one title, but there can be multiple external scripts and stylesheets. However,
those external scripts and stylesheets should only be included once. Arbitrary
head and body content, on the other hand, has no limitation (someone may want
to have five lorem ipsum blocks after all).</simpara>
<simpara>The job of a widget is to hold onto these disparate components and apply proper
logic for combining different widgets together. This consists of things like
taking the first title set and ignoring others, filtering duplicates from the
list of external scripts and stylesheets, and concatenating head and body
content.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="widgets_constructing_widgets">
<title>Constructing Widgets</title>
<simpara>In order to use widgets, you&#8217;ll obviously need to be able to get your hands on
them. The most common way will be via the <literal>ToWidget</literal> typeclass, and its
<literal>toWidget</literal> method. This allows you to convert your Shakespearean templates
directly to a <literal>Widget</literal>: Hamlet code will appear in the body, Julius scripts
inside a <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal> tag in the head, and Cassius and Lucius in a
<literal>&lt;style&gt;</literal> tag.</simpara>
<note><simpara>You can actually override the default behavior and have the script and
style code appear in a separate file. The scaffolded site provides this for you
automatically.</simpara></note>
<simpara>But what if you want to add some <literal>&lt;meta&gt;</literal> tags, which need to appear in
the head? Or if you want some Javascript to appear in the body instead of the
head? For these purposes, Yesod provides two additional type classes:
<literal>ToWidgetHead</literal> and <literal>ToWidgetBody</literal>. These work exactly as they seem they should.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition, there are a number of other functions for creating specific kinds
of Widgets:</simpara>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>
setTitle
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Turns some HTML into the page title.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
toWidgetMedia
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Works the same as toWidget, but takes an
additional parameter to indicate what kind of media this applies to. Useful for
creating print stylesheets, for instance.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
addStylesheet
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Adds a reference, via a <literal>&lt;link&gt;</literal> tag, to an external
stylesheet. Takes a type-safe URL.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
addStylesheetRemote
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Same as <literal>addStylesheet</literal>, but takes a normal URL. Useful
for referring to files hosted on a CDN, like Google&#8217;s jQuery UI CSS files.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
addScript
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Adds a reference, via a <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal> tag, to an external script.
Takes a type-safe URL.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>
addScriptRemote
</term>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Same as <literal>addScript</literal>, but takes a normal URL. Useful for
referring to files hosted on a CDN, like Google&#8217;s jQuery.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<section id="widgets_combining_widgets">
<title>Combining Widgets</title>
<simpara>The whole idea of widgets is to increase composability. You can take these
individual pieces of HTML, CSS and Javascript, combine them together into
something more complicated, and then combine these larger entities into
complete pages. This all works naturally through the <literal>Monad</literal> instance of
<literal>Widget</literal>, meaning you can use do-notation to compose pieces together.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">myWidget1 = do
    toWidget [hamlet|&lt;h1&gt;My Title|]
    toWidget [lucius|h1 { color: green } |]

myWidget2 = do
    setTitle "My Page Title"
    addScriptRemote "http://www.example.com/script.js"

myWidget = do
    myWidget1
    myWidget2

-- or, if you want
myWidget' = myWidget1 &gt;&gt; myWidget2</programlisting>
<note><simpara>If you&#8217;re so inclined, there&#8217;s also a <literal>Monoid</literal> instance of <literal>Widget</literal>,
meaning you can use <literal>mconcat</literal> or a <literal>Writer</literal> monad to build things up. In my
experience, it&#8217;s easiest and most natural to just use do-notation.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="widgets_generate_ids">
<title>Generate IDs</title>
<simpara>If we&#8217;re really going for true code reuse here, we&#8217;re eventually going to run
into name conflicts. Let&#8217;s say that there are two helper libraries that both
use the class name &#8220;foo&#8221; to affect styling. We want to avoid such a
possibility. Therefore, we have the <literal>newIdent</literal> function. This function
automatically generates a word that is unique for this handler.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">getRootR = defaultLayout $ do
    headerClass &lt;- newIdent
    toWidget [hamlet|&lt;h1 .#{headerClass}&gt;My Header|]
    toWidget [lucius| .#{headerClass} { color: green; } |]</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="widgets_whamlet">
<title>whamlet</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got a fairly standard Hamlet template, that embeds another
Hamlet template to represent the footer:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">page =
    [hamlet|
        &lt;p&gt;This is my page. I hope you enjoyed it.
        ^{footer}
    |]

footer =
    [hamlet|
        &lt;footer&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's all folks!
    |]</programlisting>
<simpara>That works fine if the footer is plain old HTML, but what if we want to add
some style? Well, we can easily spice up the footer by turning it into a
Widget:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">footer = do
    toWidget
        [lucius|
            footer {
                font-weight: bold;
                text-align: center
            }
        |]
    toWidget
        [hamlet|
            &lt;footer&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That's all folks!
        |]</programlisting>
<simpara>But now we&#8217;ve got a problem: a Hamlet template can only embed another Hamlet
template; it knows nothing about a Widget. This is where <literal>whamlet</literal> comes in. It
takes exactly the same syntax as normal Hamlet, and variable (#{&#8230;}) and URL
(@{&#8230;}) interpolation are unchanged. But embedding (<literal>^{&#8230;}</literal>) takes a <literal>Widget</literal>,
and the final result is a <literal>Widget</literal>. To use it, we can just do:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">page =
    [whamlet|
        &lt;p&gt;This is my page. I hope you enjoyed it.
        ^{footer}
    |]</programlisting>
<simpara>There is also <literal>whamletFile</literal>, if you would prefer to keep your template in a
separate file.</simpara>
<note><simpara>The scaffolded site has an even more convenient function, <literal>widgetFile</literal>,
which will also include your Lucius, Cassius, and Julius files automatically.
We&#8217;ll cover that in the scaffolding chapter.</simpara></note>
<section id="widgets_types">
<title>Types</title>
<simpara>You may have noticed that I&#8217;ve been avoiding type signatures so far. The simple
answer is that each widget is a value of type <literal>Widget</literal>. But if you look through
the Yesod libraries, you&#8217;ll find no definition of the <literal>Widget</literal> type. What
gives?</simpara>
<simpara>Yesod defines a very similar type: <literal>data WidgetT site m a</literal>. This data type is a
<emphasis role="strong">monad transformer</emphasis>. The last two arguments are the underlying monad and the
monadic value, respectively. The site parameter is the individual foundation
type for your individual application. Since this type varies for each and every
site, it&#8217;s impossible for the libraries to define a single <literal>Widget</literal> datatype
which would work for every application.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead, the <literal>mkYesod</literal> Template Haskell function generates this type synonym
for you. Assuming your foundation data type is called <literal>MyApp</literal>, your <literal>Widget</literal>
synonym is defined as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">type Widget = WidgetT MyApp IO ()</programlisting>
<simpara>We set the monadic value to be <literal>()</literal>, since a widget&#8217;s value will ultimately be
thrown away. <literal>IO</literal> is the standard base monad, and will be used in almost all
cases. The only exception is when writing a <emphasis role="strong">subsite</emphasis>. Subsites are a more
advanced topic, and will be covered later in their own chapter.</simpara>
<simpara>Once we know about our <literal>Widget</literal> type synonym, it&#8217;s easy to add signatures to
our previous code samples:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">footer :: Widget
footer = do
    toWidget
        [lucius|
            footer {
                font-weight: bold;
                text-align: center
            }
        |]
    toWidget
        [hamlet|
            &lt;footer&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;That's all folks!
        |]

page :: Widget
page =
    [whamlet|
        &lt;p&gt;This is my page. I hope you enjoyed it.
        ^{footer}
    |]</programlisting>
<simpara>When we start digging into handler functions some more, we&#8217;ll encounter a
similar situation with the <literal>HandlerT</literal> and <literal>Handler</literal> types.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="widgets_using_widgets">
<title>Using Widgets</title>
<simpara>It&#8217;s all well and good that we have these beautiful Widget datatypes, but how
exactly do we turn them into something the user can interact with? The most
commonly used function is <literal>defaultLayout</literal>, which essentially has the type
signature <literal>Widget &#8594; Handler Html</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>defaultLayout</literal> is actually a typeclass method, which can be overridden for
each application. This is how Yesod apps are themed. So we&#8217;re still left with
the question: when we&#8217;re inside <literal>defaultLayout</literal>, how do we unwrap a <literal>Widget</literal>?
The answer is <literal>widgetToPageContent</literal>. Let&#8217;s look at some (simplified) types:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">widgetToPageContent :: Widget -&gt; Handler (PageContent url)
data PageContent url = PageContent
    { pageTitle :: Html
    , pageHead :: HtmlUrl url
    , pageBody :: HtmlUrl url
    }</programlisting>
<simpara>This is getting closer to what we need. We now have direct access to the HTML
making up the head and body, as well as the title. At this point, we can use
Hamlet to combine them all together into a single document, along with our site
layout, and we use <literal>giveUrlRenderer</literal> to convert that Hamlet result into actual
HTML that&#8217;s ready to be shown to the user. The next figure demonstrates this
process.</simpara>

<simpara>This is all well and good, but there&#8217;s one thing that bothers me: that <literal>style</literal>
tag. There are a few problems with it:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Unlike Lucius or Cassius, it doesn&#8217;t get compile-time checked for
  correctness.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Granted that the current example is very simple, but in something more
  complicated we could get into character escaping issues.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
We&#8217;ll now have two style tags instead of one: the one produced by <literal>myLayout</literal>,
  and the one generated in the <literal>pageHead</literal> based on the styles set in the
  widget.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>We have one more trick in our bag to address this: we apply some last-minute
adjustments to the widget itself before calling <literal>widgetToPageContent</literal>. It&#8217;s
actually very easy to do: we just use do-notation again.</simpara>

<section id="widgets_using_handler_functions">
<title>Using handler functions</title>
<simpara>We haven&#8217;t covered too much of the handler functionality yet, but once we do,
the question arises: how do we use those functions in a widget? For example,
what if your widget needs to look up a query string parameter using
<literal>lookupGetParam</literal>?</simpara>
<simpara>The first answer is the function <literal>handlerToWidget</literal>, which can convert a
<literal>Handler</literal> action into a <literal>Widget</literal> answer. However, in many cases, this won&#8217;t be
necessary. Consider the type signature of <literal>lookupGetParam</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">lookupGetParam :: MonadHandler m =&gt; Text -&gt; m (Maybe Text)</programlisting>
<simpara>This function will live in <emphasis role="strong">any</emphasis> instance of <literal>MonadHandler</literal>. And conveniently,
<literal>Widget</literal> is also a <literal>MonadHandler</literal> instance. This means that most code can be
run in either <literal>Handler</literal> or <literal>Widget</literal>. And if you need to explicitly convert from
<literal>Handler</literal> to <literal>Widget</literal>, you can always use <literal>handlerToWidget</literal>.</simpara>
<note><simpara>This is a significant departure from how Yesod worked in versions 1.1 and
earlier. Previously, there was no <literal>MonadHandler</literal> typeclass, and all functions
needed to be explicitly converted using <literal>lift</literal>, not <literal>handlerToWidget</literal>. The new
system is not only easier to use, but also avoids any strange monad transformer
tricks which were previously employed.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="widgets_summary">
<title>Summary</title>
<simpara>The basic building block of each page is a widget. Individual snippets of HTML,
CSS, and Javascript can be turned into widgets via the polymorphic <literal>toWidget</literal>
function. Using do-notation, you can combine these individual widgets into
larger widgets, eventually containing all the content of your page.</simpara>
<simpara>Unwrapping these widgets is usually performed within the defaultLayout
function, which can be used to apply a unified look-and-feel to all your pages.</simpara>
