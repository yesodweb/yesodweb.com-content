<title>Scaffolding and the Site Template</title>
<simpara>So you&#8217;re tired of running small examples, and ready to write a real site? Then
you&#8217;re at the right chapter. Even with the entire Yesod library at your
fingertips, there are still a lot of steps you need to go through to get a
production-quality site setup:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Config file parsing
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Signal handling (*nix)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
More efficient static file serving
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A good file layout
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The scaffolded site is a combination of many Yesoders' best practices combined
together into a ready-to-use skeleton for your sites. It is highly recommended
for all sites. This chapter will explain the overall structure of the
scaffolding, how to use it, and some of its less-than-obvious features.</simpara>
<simpara>For the most part, this chapter will not contain code samples. It is
recommended that you follow along with an actual scaffolded site.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Due to the nature of the scaffolded site, it is the most fluid component
of Yesod, and can change from version to version. It is possible that the
information in this chapter is slightly outdated.</simpara></note>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_how_to_scaffold">
<title>How to Scaffold</title>
<simpara>The yesod-bin package installs an executable (conveniently named <emphasis>yesod</emphasis> as
well). This executable provides a few commands (run <emphasis>yesod</emphasis> by itself to get a
list). In order to generate a scaffolding, the command is <emphasis>yesod init</emphasis>. This
will start a question-and-answer process where you get to provide basic
details. After answering the questions, you will have a site template in a
subfolder with the name of your project.</simpara>
<simpara>The most important of these questions is the database backend. You get a few
choices here, including SQL and MongoDB backends, as well as "simple" to
include no database support.  This last option also turns off a few extra
dependencies, giving you a leaner overall site. The remainder of this chapter
will focus on the scaffoldings for one of the database backends. There will be
minor differences for the simple backend.</simpara>
<simpara>After creating your files, the scaffolder will print a message about getting
started. The suggested command runs <emphasis>cabal sandbox init</emphasis>. This will ensure
that your packages are installed only to your project directory,
avoiding conflicts with other projects.
Note that you really do need to use the <emphasis>cabal install --only-dependencies</emphasis>
command. Most likely, you do not yet
have all the dependencies in place needed by your site. For example, none of
the database backends, nor the Javascript minifier (hjsmin) are installed when
installing the <literal>yesod</literal> package.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, to launch your development site, you would use <emphasis>yesod devel</emphasis>.
This site will automatically rebuild and reload whenever
you change your code.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_file_structure">
<title>File Structure</title>
<simpara>The scaffolded site is built as a fully cabalized Haskell package. In addition
to source files, config files, templates, and static files are produced as
well.</simpara>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_cabal_file">
<title>Cabal file</title>
<simpara>Whether directly using <emphasis>cabal</emphasis>, or indirectly using <emphasis>yesod devel</emphasis>, building
your code will always go through the cabal file. If you open the file, you&#8217;ll
see that there are both library and executable blocks. If the <literal>library-only</literal>
flag is turned on, then the executable block is not built.  This is how <emphasis>yesod
devel</emphasis> calls your app. Otherwise, the executable is built.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>library-only</literal> flag should only be used by <emphasis>yesod devel</emphasis>; you should never
be explicitly passing it into <emphasis>cabal</emphasis>. There is an additional flag, <literal>dev</literal>, that
allows cabal to build an executable, but turns on some of the same features as
the library-only flag, i.e., no optimizations and reload versions of the
Shakespearean template functions.</simpara>
<simpara>In general, you will build as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
When developing, use <emphasis>yesod devel</emphasis> exclusively.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
When building a production build, perform <emphasis>cabal clean &amp;&amp; cabal
  configure &amp;&amp; cabal build</emphasis>. This will produce an optimized executable
  in your <emphasis>dist</emphasis> folder.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>You might be surprised to see the <literal>NoImplicitPrelude</literal> extension. We turn this
on since the site includes its own module, <literal>Import</literal>, with a few changes to the
Prelude that make working with Yesod a little more convenient.</simpara>
<simpara>The last thing to note is the exported-modules list. If you add any modules to
your application, you <emphasis role="strong">must</emphasis> update this list to get yesod devel to work
correctly. Unfortunately, neither Cabal nor GHC will give you a warning if you
forgot to make this update, and instead you&#8217;ll get a very scary-looking error
message from yesod devel.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_routes_and_entities">
<title>Routes and entities</title>
<simpara>Multiple times in this book, you&#8217;ve seen a comment like "We&#8217;re declaring our
routes/entities with quasiquotes for convenience. In a production site, you
should use an external file." The scaffolding uses such an external file.</simpara>
<simpara>Routes are defined in <emphasis>config/routes</emphasis>, and entities in <emphasis>config/models</emphasis>. They
have the exact same syntax as the quasiquoting you&#8217;ve seen throughout the book,
and <emphasis>yesod devel</emphasis> knows to automatically recompile the appropriate modules when
these files change.</simpara>
<simpara>The <emphasis>models</emphasis> files is referenced by <literal>Model.hs</literal>. You are free to declare
whatever you like in this file, but here are some guidelines:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Any data types used in <emphasis>entities</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">must</emphasis> be imported/declared in <emphasis>Model.hs</emphasis>,
  above the <literal>persistFile</literal> call.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Helper utilities should either be declared in <literal>Import.hs</literal> or, if very
  model-centric, in a file within the <literal>Model</literal> folder and imported into
  <emphasis>Import.hs</emphasis>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_foundation_and_application_modules">
<title>Foundation and Application modules</title>
<simpara>The <literal>mkYesod</literal> function which we have used throughout the book declares a few
things:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Route type
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Route render function
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Dispatch function
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The dispatch function refers to all of the handler functions, and therefore all
of those must either be defined in the same file as the dispatch function, or
be imported by the dispatch function.</simpara>
<simpara>Meanwhile, the handler functions will almost certainly refer to the route type.
Therefore, <emphasis>they</emphasis> must be either in the same file where the route type is
defined, or must import that file. If you follow the logic here, your entire
application must essentially live in a single file!</simpara>
<simpara>Clearly this isn&#8217;t what we want. So instead of using <literal>mkYesod</literal>, the scaffolding
site uses a decomposed version of the function. <literal>Foundation</literal> calls
<literal>mkYesodData</literal>, which declares the route type and render function. Since it does
not declare the dispatch function, the handler functions need not be in scope.
<literal>Import.hs</literal> imports <literal>Foundation.hs</literal>, and all the handler modules import
<literal>Import.hs</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In <literal>Application.hs</literal>, we call <literal>mkYesodDispatch</literal>, which creates our dispatch
function. For this to work, all handler functions must be in scope, so be sure
to add an import statement for any new handler modules you create.</simpara>
<simpara>Other than that, <emphasis>Application.hs</emphasis> is pretty simple. It provides two primary
functions: <literal>getApplicationDev</literal> is used by <emphasis>yesod devel</emphasis> to launch your app, and
<literal>makeApplication</literal> is used by the executable to launch.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>Foundation.hs</emphasis> is much more exciting. It:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Declares your foundation datatype
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Declares a number of instances, such as <literal>Yesod</literal>, <literal>YesodAuth</literal>, and
  <literal>YesodPersist</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Imports the messages files. If you look for the line starting with
  <literal>mkMessage</literal>, you will see that it specifies the folder containing the
  messages (<emphasis>messages</emphasis>) and the default language (en, for English).
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>This is the right file for adding extra instances for your foundation, such as
<literal>YesodAuthEmail</literal> or <literal>YesodBreadcrumbs</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll be referring back to this file later, as we discussed some of the special
implementations of <literal>Yesod</literal> typeclass methods.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_import">
<title>Import</title>
<simpara>The <literal>Import</literal> module was born out of a few commonly recurring patterns.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
I want to define some helper functions (maybe the <literal>&lt;&gt; = mappend</literal>
  operator) to be used by all handlers.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
I&#8217;m always adding the same five import statements (<literal>Data.Text</literal>,
  <literal>Control.Applicative</literal>, etc) to every handler module.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
I want to make sure I never use some evil function (<literal>head</literal>, <literal>readFile</literal>, &#8230;) from <literal>Prelude</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note>
<simpara>Yes, evil is hyperbole. If you&#8217;re wondering why I listed those functions as bad: <literal>head</literal> is partial, and throws exceptions on an empty list, and <literal>readFile</literal> uses lazy I/O, which doesn&#8217;t close file handles quickly enough. Also, <literal>readFile</literal> uses <literal>String</literal> instead of <literal>Text</literal>.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>The solution is to turn on the <literal>NoImplicitPrelude</literal> language extension,
re-export the parts of <literal>Prelude</literal> we want, add in all the other stuff we want,
define our own functions as well, and then import this file in all handlers.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_handler_modules">
<title>Handler modules</title>
<simpara>Handler modules should go inside the <emphasis>Handler</emphasis> folder. The site template
includes one module: <emphasis>Handler/Root.hs</emphasis>. How you split up your handler functions
into individual modules is your decision, but a good rule of thumb is:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Different methods for the same route should go in the same file, e.g.
  <literal>getBlogR</literal> and <literal>postBlogR</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Related routes can also usually go in the same file, e.g., <literal>getPeopleR</literal> and
  <literal>getPersonR</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Of course, it&#8217;s entirely up to you. When you add a new handler file, make sure
you do the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Add it to version control (you <emphasis>are</emphasis> using version control, right?).
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Add it to the cabal file.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Add it to the <emphasis>Application.hs</emphasis> file.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Put a module statement at the top, and an <literal>import Import</literal> line below it.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>You can use the <emphasis>yesod add-handler</emphasis> command to automate the last three steps.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_widgetfile">
<title>widgetFile</title>
<simpara>It&#8217;s very common to want to include CSS and Javascript specific to a page. You
don&#8217;t want to have to remember to include those Lucius and Julius files
manually every time you refer to a Hamlet file. For this, the site template
provides the <literal>widgetFile</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>If you have a handler function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">getRootR = defaultLayout $(widgetFile "homepage")</programlisting>
<simpara>, Yesod will look for the following files:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis>templates/homepage.hamlet</emphasis>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis>templates/homepage.lucius</emphasis>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis>templates/homepage.cassius</emphasis>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis>templates/homepage.julius</emphasis>
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>If any of those files are present, they will be automatically included in the
output.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Due to the nature of how this works, if you launch your app with <emphasis>yesod
devel</emphasis>, and then create a new file (e.g., <emphasis>templates/homepage.julius</emphasis>), the
contents will <emphasis>not</emphasis> be included until the file calling <literal>widgetFile</literal> is
recompiled. In such a case, you may need to force a save of that file to get
<emphasis>yesod devel</emphasis> to recompile.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_defaultlayout">
<title>defaultLayout</title>
<simpara>One of the first things you&#8217;re going to want to customize is the look of your
site. The layout is actually broken up into two files:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis>templates/default-layout-wrapper.hamlet</emphasis> contains just the basic shell of a
   page. This file is interpreted as plain Hamlet, not as a Widget, and
   therefore cannot refer to other widgets, embed i18n strings, or add extra
   CSS/JS.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis>templates/default-layout.hamlet</emphasis> is where you would put the bulk of your
   page. You <emphasis role="strong">must</emphasis> remember to include the <literal>widget</literal> value in the page, as that
   contains the per-page contents. This file is interpreted as a Widget.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Also, since default-layout is included via the <literal>widgetFile</literal> function, any
Lucius, Cassius, or Julius files named <emphasis>default-layout.*</emphasis> will automatically be
included as well.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_static_files">
<title>Static files</title>
<simpara>The scaffolded site automatically includes the static file subsite, optimized
for serving files that will not change over the lifetime of the current build.
What this means is that:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
When your static file identifiers are generated (e.g., <emphasis>static/mylogo.png</emphasis>
  becomes <literal>mylogo_png</literal>), a query-string parameter is added to it with a hash of
  the contents of the file. All of this happens at compile time.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
When <literal>yesod-static</literal> serves your static files, it sets expiration headers far
  in the future, and incldues an etag based on a hash of your content.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Whenever you embed a link to <literal>mylogo_png</literal>, the rendering includes the
  query-string parameter. If you change the logo, recompile, and launch your
  new app, the query string will have changed, causing users to ignore the
  cached copy and download a new version.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Additionally, you can set a specific static root in your <emphasis>Settings.hs</emphasis> file to
serve from a different domain name. This has the advantage of not requiring
transmission of cookies for static file requests, and also lets you offload
static file hosting to a CDN or a service like Amazon S3. See the comments in
the file for more details.</simpara>
<simpara>Another optimization is that CSS and Javascript included in your widgets will
not be included inside your HTML. Instead, their contents will be written to an
external file, and a link given. This file will be named based on a hash of the
contents as well, meaning:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Caching works properly.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Yesod can avoid an expensive disk write of the CSS/Javascript file contents if a file with the same hash already exists.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>Finally, all of your Javascript is automatically minified via hjsmin.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="scaffolding-and-the-site-template_conclusion">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<simpara>The purpose of this chapter was not to explain every line that exists in the
scaffolded site, but instead to give a general overview to how it works. The
best way to become more familiar with it is to jump right in and start writing
a Yesod site with it.</simpara>
