<title>Basics</title>
<simpara>The first step with any new technology is getting it running. The goal of
this chapter is to get you started with a simple Yesod application, and cover
some of the basic concepts and terminology.</simpara>
<section id="basics_hello_world">
<title>Hello World</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s get this book started properly: a simple web page that says Hello
World:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes           #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell       #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies          #-}
import           Yesod

data HelloWorld = HelloWorld

mkYesod "HelloWorld" [parseRoutes|
/ HomeR GET
|]

instance Yesod HelloWorld

getHomeR :: Handler Html
getHomeR = defaultLayout [whamlet|Hello World!|]

main :: IO ()
main = warp 3000 HelloWorld</programlisting>
<simpara>If you save that code in <literal>helloworld.hs</literal> and run it with <literal>runhaskell
helloworld.hs</literal>, you&#8217;ll get a web server running on port 3000. Note,
if you followed the quick start guide and installed yesod with <literal>stack</literal>
then you will not have <literal>runhaskell</literal> and will need to run <literal>stack runghc
helloworld.hs</literal> instead. If you point your browser to <ulink url="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</ulink>,
you&#8217;ll get the following HTML:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll refer back to this example through the rest of the chapter.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_routing">
<title>Routing</title>
<simpara>Like most modern web frameworks, Yesod follows a
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Controller_pattern">front controller
pattern</ulink>. This means that every request to a Yesod application enters at the
same point and is routed from there. As a contrast, in systems like PHP and ASP
you usually create a number of different files, and the web server
automatically directs requests to the relevant file.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition, Yesod uses a declarative style for specifying routes. In our
example above, this looked like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">mkYesod "HelloWorld" [parseRoutes|
/ HomeR GET
|]</programlisting>
<note><simpara><literal>mkYesod</literal> is a Template Haskell function, and <literal>parseRoutes</literal> is a
QuasiQuoter.</simpara></note>
<simpara>In English, all this means is: In the HelloWorld application, create one route.
I&#8217;d like to call it <literal>HomeR</literal>, it should listen for requests to <literal>/</literal> (the root of
the application), and should answer <literal>GET</literal> requests. We call <literal>HomeR</literal> a resource,
which is where the "R" suffix comes from.</simpara>
<note><simpara>The R suffix on resource names is simply a convention, but it&#8217;s a fairly
universally followed convention. It makes it just a bit easier to read and
understand the code.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The <literal>mkYesod</literal> TH function generates quite a bit of code here: a route data
type, parser/render functions, a dispatch function, and some helper types.
We&#8217;ll look at this in more detail in the routing chapter. But by using the
<literal>-ddump-splices</literal> GHC option, we can get an immediate look at the generated
code. A much cleaned up version of it is:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance RenderRoute HelloWorld where
    data Route HelloWorld = HomeR
        deriving (Show, Eq, Read)
    renderRoute HomeR = ([], [])

instance ParseRoute HelloWorld where
    parseRoute ([], _) = Just HomeR
    parseRoute _       = Nothing

instance YesodDispatch HelloWorld where
    yesodDispatch env req =
        yesodRunner handler env mroute req
      where
        mroute = parseRoute (pathInfo req, textQueryString req)
        handler =
            case mroute of
                Nothing -&gt; notFound
                Just HomeR -&gt;
                    case requestMethod req of
                        "GET" -&gt; getHomeR
                        _     -&gt; badMethod

type Handler = HandlerFor HelloWorld</programlisting>
<note><simpara>In addition to using <literal>-ddump-splices</literal>, it can often be useful to generate
Haddock documentation for your application to see which functions and data
types were generated for you.</simpara></note>
<simpara>We can see that the <literal>RenderRoute</literal> class defines an <emphasis role="strong">associated data type</emphasis>
providing the routes for our application. In this simple example, we have just
one route: <literal>HomeR</literal>. In real life applications, we&#8217;ll have many more, and they
will be more complicated than our <literal>HomeR</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>renderRoute</literal> takes a route and turns it into path segments and query string
parameters. Again, our example is simple, so the code is likewise simple: both
values are empty lists.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>ParseRoute</literal> provides the inverse function, <literal>parseRoute</literal>. Here we see the first
strong motivation for our reliance on Template Haskell: it ensures that the
parsing and rendering of routes correspond correctly with each other. This kind
of code can easily become difficult to keep in sync when written by hand. By
relying on code generation, we&#8217;re letting the compiler (and Yesod) handle those
details for us.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>YesodDispatch</literal> provides a means of taking an input request and passing it to
the appropriate handler function. The process is essentially:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Parse the request.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Choose a handler function.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Run the handler function.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>The code generation follows a simple format for matching routes to handler
function names, which we&#8217;ll describe in the next section.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, we have a simple type synonym defining <literal>Handler</literal> to make our code a
little easier to write.</simpara>
<simpara>There&#8217;s a lot more going on here than we&#8217;ve described. The generated dispatch
code actually uses the view patterns language extension for efficiency, more
type class instances are created, and there are other cases to handle such as
subsites.  We&#8217;ll get into the details as we go through the book, especially in
the &#8220;Understanding a Request&#8221; chapter.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_handler_function">
<title>Handler function</title>
<simpara>So we have a route named <literal>HomeR</literal>, and it responds to <literal>GET</literal> requests. How do you
define your response? You write a handler function. Yesod follows a standard
naming scheme for these functions: it&#8217;s the lower case method name (e.g., <literal>GET</literal>
becomes <literal>get</literal>) followed by the route name. In this case, the function name
would be <literal>getHomeR</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Most of the code you write in Yesod lives in handler functions. This is where
you process user input, perform database queries and create responses. In our
simple example, we create a response using the <literal>defaultLayout</literal> function. This
function wraps up the content it&#8217;s given in your site&#8217;s template. By default,
it produces an HTML file with a doctype and <literal>html</literal>, <literal>head</literal> and <literal>body</literal> tags. As
we&#8217;ll see in the Yesod typeclass chapter, this function can be overridden to do
much more.</simpara>
<simpara>In our example, we pass <literal>[whamlet|Hello World!|]</literal> to <literal>defaultLayout</literal>.
<literal>whamlet</literal> is another quasi-quoter. In this case, it converts Hamlet syntax into
a Widget. Hamlet is the default HTML templating engine in Yesod. Together with
its siblings Cassius, Lucius and Julius, you can create HTML, CSS and
JavaScript in a fully type-safe and compile-time-checked manner. We&#8217;ll see much
more about this in the Shakespeare chapter.</simpara>
<simpara>Widgets are another cornerstone of Yesod. They allow you to create modular
components of a site consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and reuse them
throughout your site. We&#8217;ll get into more detail on them in the widgets
chapter.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_the_foundation">
<title>The Foundation</title>
<simpara>The word &#8216;HelloWorld&#8217; shows up a number of times in our example. Every Yesod
application has a foundation datatype. This datatype must be an instance of the
<literal>Yesod</literal> typeclass, which provides a central place for declaring a number of
different settings controlling the execution of our application.</simpara>
<simpara>In our case, this datatype is pretty boring: it doesn&#8217;t contain any
information. Nonetheless, the foundation is central to how our example runs: it
ties together the routes with the instance declaration and lets it all be run.
We&#8217;ll see throughout this book that the foundation pops up in a whole bunch of
places.</simpara>
<simpara>But foundations don&#8217;t have to be boring: they can be used to store lots of
useful information, usually stuff that needs to be initialized at program
launch and used throughout. Some very common examples are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A database connection pool.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Settings loaded from a config file.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
An HTTP connection manager.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A random number generator.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><simpara>By the way, the word Yesod (יסוד) means <emphasis>foundation</emphasis> in Hebrew.</simpara></note>
</section>
<section id="basics_running">
<title>Running</title>
<simpara>Once again we mention <literal>HelloWorld</literal> in our main function. Our foundation
contains all the information we need to route and respond to requests in our
application; now we just need to convert it into something that can run. A
useful function for this in Yesod is <literal>warp</literal>, which runs the Warp web server with
a number of default settings enabled on the specified port (here, it&#8217;s 3000).</simpara>
<simpara>One of the features of Yesod is that you aren&#8217;t tied down to a single
deployment strategy. Yesod is built on top of the Web Application Interface
(WAI), allowing it to run on FastCGI, SCGI, Warp, or even as a desktop
application using the Webkit library. We&#8217;ll discuss some of these options in
the deployment chapter. And at the end of this chapter, we will explain the
development server.</simpara>
<simpara>Warp is the premiere deployment option for Yesod. It is a lightweight, highly
efficient web server developed specifically for hosting Yesod. It is also used
outside of Yesod for other Haskell development (both framework and
non-framework applications), as well as a standard file server in a number of
production environments.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_resources_and_type_safe_urls">
<title>Resources and type-safe URLs</title>
<simpara>In our hello world, we defined just a single resource (<literal>HomeR</literal>). A web
application is usually much more exciting with more than one page on it. Let&#8217;s
take a look:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes           #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell       #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies          #-}
import           Yesod

data Links = Links

mkYesod "Links" [parseRoutes|
/ HomeR GET
/page1 Page1R GET
/page2 Page2R GET
|]

instance Yesod Links

getHomeR  = defaultLayout [whamlet|&lt;a href=@{Page1R}&gt;Go to page 1!|]
getPage1R = defaultLayout [whamlet|&lt;a href=@{Page2R}&gt;Go to page 2!|]
getPage2R = defaultLayout [whamlet|&lt;a href=@{HomeR}&gt;Go home!|]

main = warp 3000 Links</programlisting>
<simpara>Overall, this is very similar to Hello World. Our foundation is now <literal>Links</literal>
instead of <literal>HelloWorld</literal>, and in addition to the <literal>HomeR</literal> resource, we&#8217;ve added
<literal>Page1R</literal> and <literal>Page2R</literal>. As such, we&#8217;ve also added two more handler functions:
<literal>getPage1R</literal> and <literal>getPage2R</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The only truly new feature is inside the <literal>whamlet</literal> quasi-quotation. We&#8217;ll delve
into syntax in the &#8220;Shakespeare&#8221; chapter, but we can see that:</simpara>
<screen>&lt;a href=@{Page1R}&gt;Go to page 1!</screen>
<simpara>creates a link to the <literal>Page1R</literal> resource. The important thing to note here is
that <literal>Page1R</literal> is a data constructor. By making each resource a data
constructor, we have a feature called <emphasis>type-safe URLs</emphasis>. Instead of splicing
together strings to create URLs, we simply create a plain old Haskell value. By
using at-sign interpolation (<literal>@{&#8230;}</literal>), Yesod automatically renders those
values to textual URLs before sending things off to the user. We can see how
this is implemented by looking again at the <literal>-ddump-splices</literal> output:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">instance RenderRoute Links where
    data Route Links = HomeR | Page1R | Page2R
      deriving (Show, Eq, Read)

    renderRoute HomeR  = ([], [])
    renderRoute Page1R = (["page1"], [])
    renderRoute Page2R = (["page2"], [])</programlisting>
<simpara>In the <literal>Route</literal> associated type for <literal>Links</literal>, we have additional constructors for
<literal>Page1R</literal> and <literal>Page2R</literal>. We also now have a better glimpse of the return values
for <literal>renderRoute</literal>. The first part of the tuple gives the path pieces for the
given route. The second part gives the query string parameters; for almost all
use cases, this will be an empty list.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s hard to over-estimate the value of type-safe URLs. They give you a huge
amount of flexibility and robustness when developing your application. You can
move URLs around at will without ever breaking links. In the routing chapter,
we&#8217;ll see that routes can take parameters, such as a blog entry URL taking the
blog post ID.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say you want to switch from routing on the numerical post ID to a
year/month/slug setup. In a traditional web framework, you would need to go
through every single reference to your blog post route and update
appropriately. If you miss one, you&#8217;ll have 404s at runtime. In Yesod, all you
do is update your route and compile: GHC will pinpoint every single line of
code that needs to be corrected.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_non_html_responses">
<title>Non-HTML responses</title>
<simpara>Yesod can serve up any kind of content you want, and has first-class support
for many commonly used response formats. You&#8217;ve seen HTML so far, but JSON data
is just as easy, via the aeson package:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE ExtendedDefaultRules #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings    #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes          #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell      #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies         #-}
import Yesod

data App = App

mkYesod "App" [parseRoutes|
/ HomeR GET
|]

instance Yesod App

getHomeR  = return $ object ["msg" .= "Hello World"]

main = warp 3000 App</programlisting>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll cover JSON responses in more detail in later chapters, including how to
automatically switch between HTML and JSON representations depending on the
<literal>Accept</literal> request header.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_the_scaffolded_site">
<title>The scaffolded site</title>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll use <literal>stack</literal> to install the Yesod libraries and the <literal>yesod</literal> helper
executable. Then we&#8217;ll use <literal>stack new</literal> to create a scaffolded site. It
will generate a folder containing the default scaffolded site. Inside that
folder, you can run <literal>stack install --only-dependencies</literal> to build any extra
dependencies (such as your database backends), and then <literal>yesod devel</literal> to run
your site.</simpara>
<note><simpara>For getting your package environment set up, please be sure to follow the
<ulink url="http://www.yesodweb.com/page/quickstart">quick start guide</ulink>.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The scaffolded site gives you a lot of best practices out of the box, setting
up files and dependencies in a time-tested approach used by most production
Yesod sites. However, all this convenience can get in the way of actually
learning Yesod. Therefore, most of this book will avoid the scaffolding tool,
and instead deal directly with Yesod as a library. But if you&#8217;re going to build
a real site, I strongly recommend using the scaffolding.</simpara>
<simpara>We will cover the structure of the scaffolded site in the scaffolding chapter.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_development_server">
<title>Development server</title>
<simpara>One of the advantages interpreted languages have over compiled languages is
fast prototyping: you save changes to a file and hit refresh. If we want to
make any changes to our Yesod apps above, we&#8217;ll need to call <emphasis>runhaskell</emphasis> from
scratch, which can be a bit tedious.</simpara>
<simpara>Fortunately, there&#8217;s a solution to this: <literal>yesod devel</literal> automatically rebuilds
and reloads your code for you. This can be a great way to develop your Yesod
projects, and when you&#8217;re ready to move to production, you still get to compile
down to incredibly efficient code. The Yesod scaffolding automatically sets
things up for you. This gives you the best of both worlds: rapid prototyping
<emphasis role="strong">and</emphasis> fast production code.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s a little bit more involved to set up your code to be used by <emphasis>yesod
devel</emphasis>, so our examples will just use <literal>warp</literal>. Fortunately, the scaffolded site
is fully configured to use the development server, so when you&#8217;re ready to move
over to the real world, it will be waiting for you.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="basics_summary">
<title>Summary</title>
<simpara>Every Yesod application is built around a foundation datatype. We associate
some resources with that datatype and define some handler functions, and Yesod
handles all of the routing. These resources are also data constructors, which
lets us have type-safe URLs.</simpara>
<simpara>By being built on top of WAI, Yesod applications can run with a number of
different backends. For simple apps, the <literal>warp</literal> function provides a convenient
way to use the Warp web server. For rapid development, using <literal>yesod devel</literal> is a
good choice.  And when you&#8217;re ready to move to production, you have the full
power and flexibility to configure Warp (or any other WAI handler) to suit your
needs.</simpara>
<simpara>When developing in Yesod, we get a number of choices for coding style:
quasi-quotation or external files, <literal>warp</literal> or <literal>yesod devel</literal>, and so on. The
examples in this book will tend towards using the choices that are easiest to
copy-and-paste, but the more powerful options will be available when you start
building real Yesod applications.</simpara>
