<title>xml-conduit</title>
<simpara>Many developers cringe at the thought of dealing with XML files. XML has the
reputation of having a complicated data model, with obfuscated libraries and
huge layers of complexity sitting between you and your goal. I&#8217;d like to posit
that a lot of that pain is actually a language and library issue, not inherent
to XML.</simpara>
<simpara>Once again, Haskell&#8217;s type system allows us to easily break down the problem to
its most basic form. The xml-types package neatly deconstructs the XML data
model (both a streaming and DOM-based approach) into some simple ADTs.
Haskell&#8217;s standard immutable data structures make it easier to apply transforms
to documents, and a simple set of functions makes parsing and rendering a
breeze.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;re going to be covering the xml-conduit package. Under the surface, this
package uses a lot of the approaches Yesod in general does for high
performance: blaze-builder, text, conduit and attoparsec. But from a user
perspective, it provides everything from the simplest APIs
(<literal>readFile</literal>/<literal>writeFile</literal>) through full control of XML event streams.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition to <literal>xml-conduit</literal>, there are a few related packages that come into
play, like xml-hamlet and xml2html. We&#8217;ll cover both how to use all these
packages, and when they should be used.</simpara>

<section id="xml_types">
<title>Types</title>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take a bottom-up approach to analyzing types. This section will also
serve as a primer on the XML data model itself, so don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re not
completely familiar with it.</simpara>
<simpara>I think the first place where Haskell really shows its strength is with the
<literal>Name</literal> datatype. Many languages (like Java) struggle with properly expressing
names. The issue is that there are in fact three components to a name: its
local name, its namespace (optional), and its prefix (also optional). Let&#8217;s
look at some XML to explain:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;no-namespace/&gt;
&lt;no-prefix xmlns="first-namespace" first-attr="value1"/&gt;
&lt;foo:with-prefix xmlns:foo="second-namespace" foo:second-attr="value2"/&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The first tag has a local name of <literal>no-namespace</literal>, and no namespace or prefix.
The second tag (local name: <literal>no-prefix</literal>) <emphasis>also</emphasis> has no prefix, but it does have
a namespace (<literal>first-namespace</literal>). <literal>first-attr</literal>, however, does <emphasis>not</emphasis> inherit that
namespace: attribute namespaces must always be explicitly set with a prefix.</simpara>
<note><simpara>Namespaces are almost always URIs of some sort, though there is nothing
in any specification requiring that it be so.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The third tag has a local name of <literal>with-prefix</literal>, a prefix of <literal>foo</literal> and a
namespace of <literal>second-namespace</literal>. Its attribute has a <literal>second-attr</literal> local name
and the same prefix and namespace. The <literal>xmlns</literal> and <literal>xmlns:foo</literal> attributes are
part of the namespace specification, and are not considered attributes of their
respective elements.</simpara>
<simpara>So let&#8217;s review what we need from a name: every name has a local name, and it
can optionally have a prefix and namespace. Seems like a simple fit for a
record type:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Name = Name
    { nameLocalName :: Text
    , nameNamespace :: Maybe Text
    , namePrefix    :: Maybe Text
    }</programlisting>
<simpara>According the the XML namespace standard, two names are considered equivalent
if they have the same localname and namespace. In other words, the prefix is
not important. Therefore, <literal>xml-types</literal> defines <literal>Eq</literal> and <literal>Ord</literal> instances that
ignore the prefix.</simpara>
<simpara>The last class instance worth mentioning is <literal>IsString</literal>. It would be very
tedious to have to manually type out <literal>Name "p" Nothing Nothing</literal> every time we
want a paragraph. If you turn on <literal>OverloadedStrings</literal>, <literal>"p"</literal> will resolve to
that all by itself! In addition, the <literal>IsString</literal> instance recognizes something
called Clark notation, which allows you to prefix the namespace surrounded in
curly brackets. In other words:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">"{namespace}element" == Name "element" (Just "namespace") Nothing
"element" == Name "element" Nothing Nothing</programlisting>
<section id="xml_the_four_types_of_nodes">
<title>The Four Types of Nodes</title>
<simpara>XML documents are a tree of nested nodes. There are in fact four different
types of nodes allowed: elements, content (i.e., text), comments, and
processing instructions.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>You may not be familiar with that last one, it&#8217;s less commonly used. It is marked up as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;?target data?&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>There are two surprising facts about processing instructions (PIs):</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
PIs don&#8217;t have attributes. While often times you&#8217;ll see processing
  instructions that appear to have attributes, there are in fact no rules about
  that data of an instruction.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <literal>&lt;?xml &#8230;?&gt;</literal> stuff at the beginning of a document is not a
  processing instruction. It is simply the beginning of the document (known as
  the XML declaration), and happens to look an awful lot like a PI. The
  difference though is that the <literal>&lt;?xml &#8230;?&gt;</literal> line will not appear in
  your parsed content.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</note>
<simpara>Since processing instructions have two pieces of text associated with them (the
target and the data), we have a simple data type:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Instruction = Instruction
    { instructionTarget :: Text
    , instructionData :: Text
    }</programlisting>
<simpara>Comments have no special datatype, since they are just text. But content is an
interesting one: it could contain either plain text or unresolved entities
(e.g., <literal>&amp;copyright-statement;</literal>). xml-types keeps those unresolved entities
in all the data types in order to completely match the spec. However, in
practice, it can be very tedious to program against those data types. And in
most use cases, an unresolved entity is going to end up as an error anyway.</simpara>
<simpara>Therefore, the <literal>Text.XML</literal> module defines its own set of datatypes for nodes,
elements and documents that removes all unresolved entities. If you need to
deal with unresolved entities instead, you should use the <literal>Text.XML.Unresolved</literal>
module.  From now on, we&#8217;ll be focusing only on the <literal>Text.XML</literal> data types,
though they are almost identical to the <literal>xml-types</literal> versions.</simpara>
<simpara>Anyway, after that detour: content is just a piece of text, and therefore it
too does not have a special datatype. The last node type is an element, which
contains three pieces of information: a name, a map of attribute name/value
pairs, and a list of children nodes. (In <literal>xml-types</literal>, this value could contain
unresolved entities as well.) So our <literal>Element</literal> is defined as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Element = Element
    { elementName :: Name
    , elementAttributes :: Map Name Text
    , elementNodes :: [Node]
    }</programlisting>
<simpara>Which of course begs the question: what does a <literal>Node</literal> look like? This is where
Haskell really shines: its sum types model the XML data model perfectly.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Node
    = NodeElement Element
    | NodeInstruction Instruction
    | NodeContent Text
    | NodeComment Text</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="xml_documents">
<title>Documents</title>
<simpara>So now we have elements and nodes, but what about an entire document? Let&#8217;s
just lay out the datatypes:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">data Document = Document
    { documentPrologue :: Prologue
    , documentRoot :: Element
    , documentEpilogue :: [Miscellaneous]
    }

data Prologue = Prologue
    { prologueBefore :: [Miscellaneous]
    , prologueDoctype :: Maybe Doctype
    , prologueAfter :: [Miscellaneous]
    }

data Miscellaneous
    = MiscInstruction Instruction
    | MiscComment Text

data Doctype = Doctype
    { doctypeName :: Text
    , doctypeID :: Maybe ExternalID
    }

data ExternalID
    = SystemID Text
    | PublicID Text Text</programlisting>
<simpara>The XML spec says that a document has a single root element (<literal>documentRoot</literal>).
It also has an optional doctype statement. Before and after both the doctype
and the root element, you are allowed to have comments and processing
instructions. (You can also have whitespace, but that is ignored in the
parsing.)</simpara>
<simpara>So what&#8217;s up with the doctype? Well, it specifies the root element of the
document, and then optional public and system identifiers. These are used to
refer to DTD files, which give more information about the file (e.g.,
validation rules, default attributes, entity resolution). Let&#8217;s see some
examples:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!DOCTYPE root&gt; &lt;!-- no external identifier --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE root SYSTEM "root.dtd"&gt; &lt;!-- a system identifier --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE root PUBLIC "My Root Public Identifier" "root.dtd"&gt; &lt;!-- public identifiers have a system ID as well --&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>And that, my friends, is the entire XML data model. For many parsing purposes,
you&#8217;ll be able to simply ignore the entire <literal>Document</literal> datatype and go
immediately to the <literal>documentRoot</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="xml_events">
<title>Events</title>
<simpara>In addition to the document API, <literal>xml-types</literal> defines an Event datatype. This
can be used for constructing streaming tools, which can be much more memory
efficient for certain kinds of processing (eg, adding an extra attribute to all
elements). We will not be covering the streaming API currently, though it
should look very familiar after analyzing the document API.</simpara>
<note><simpara>You can see an example of the streaming API in the Sphinx case study.</simpara></note>
</section>
</section>
<section id="xml_text_xml">
<title>Text.XML</title>
<simpara>The recommended entry point to xml-conduit is the Text.XML module. This module
exports all of the datatypes you&#8217;ll need to manipulate XML in a DOM fashion, as
well as a number of different approaches for parsing and rendering XML content.
Let&#8217;s start with the simple ones:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">readFile  :: ParseSettings  -&gt; FilePath -&gt; IO Document
writeFile :: RenderSettings -&gt; FilePath -&gt; Document -&gt; IO ()</programlisting>
<simpara>This introduces the <literal>ParseSettings</literal> and <literal>RenderSettings</literal> datatypes. You can use
these to modify the behavior of the parser and renderer, such as adding
character entities and turning on pretty (i.e., indented) output. Both these
types are instances of the Default typeclass, so you can simply use <literal>def</literal> when
these need to be supplied. That is how we will supply these values through the
rest of the chapter; please see the API docs for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that in addition to the file-based API, there is also a
text- and bytestring-based API. The bytestring-powered functions all perform
intelligent encoding detections, and support UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32, in
either big or little endian, with and without a Byte-Order Marker (BOM). All
output is generated in UTF-8.</simpara>
<simpara>For complex data lookups, we recommend using the higher-level cursors API. The
standard <literal>Text.XML</literal> API not only forms the basis for that higher level, but is
also a great API for simple XML transformations and for XML generation. See the
synopsis for an example.</simpara>
<section id="xml_a_note_about_file_paths">
<title>A note about file paths</title>
<simpara>In the type signature above, we have a type <literal>FilePath</literal>. However, <emphasis role="strong">this isn&#8217;t
Prelude.FilePath</emphasis>. The standard <literal>Prelude</literal> defines a type synonym <literal>type FilePath
= [Char]</literal>. Unfortunately, there are many limitations to using such an
approach, including confusion of filename character encodings and differences
in path separators.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead, <literal>xml-conduit</literal> uses the system-filepath package, which defines an
abstract <literal>FilePath</literal> type. I&#8217;ve personally found this to be a much nicer
approach to work with. The package is fairly easy to follow, so I won&#8217;t go into
details here. But I do want to give a few quick explanations of how to use it:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Since a <literal>FilePath</literal> is an instance of <literal>IsString</literal>, you can type in regular
  strings and they will be treated properly, as long as the <literal>OverloadedStrings</literal>
  extension is enabled. (I highly recommend enabling it anyway, as it makes
  dealing with <literal>Text</literal> values much more pleasant.)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If you need to explicitly convert to or from <literal>Prelude</literal>'s <literal>FilePath</literal>, you
  should use the encodeString and decodeString, respectively. This takes into
  account file path encodings.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Instead of manually splicing together directory names and file names with
  extensions, use the operators in the <literal>Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS</literal> module, e.g.
  <literal>myfolder &lt;/&gt; filename &lt;.&gt; extension</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
</section>
<section id="xml_cursor">
<title>Cursor</title>
<simpara>Suppose you want to pull the title out of an XHTML document. You could do so
with the <literal>Text.XML</literal> interface we just described, using standard pattern
matching on the children of elements. But that would get very tedious, very
quickly. Probably the gold standard for these kinds of lookups is XPath, where
you would be able to write <literal>/html/head/title</literal>. And that&#8217;s exactly what inspired
the design of the Text.XML.Cursor combinators.</simpara>
<simpara>A cursor is an XML node that knows its location in the tree; it&#8217;s able to
traverse upwards, sideways, and downwards. (Under the surface, this is achieved
by <ulink url="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tying_the_Knot">tying the knot</ulink>.)
There are two functions available for creating cursors from <literal>Text.XML</literal> types:
<literal>fromDocument</literal> and <literal>fromNode</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>We also have the concept of an Axis, defined as <literal>type Axis = Cursor -&gt;
[Cursor]</literal>. It&#8217;s easiest to get started by looking at example axes: child
returns zero or more cursors that are the child of the current one, parent
returns the single parent cursor of the input, or an empty list if the input is
the root element, and so on.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition, there are some axes that take predicates. <literal>element</literal> is a commonly
used function that filters down to only elements which match the given name.
For example, <literal>element "title"</literal> will return the input element if its name is
"title", or an empty list otherwise.</simpara>
<simpara>Another common function which isn&#8217;t quite an axis is <literal>content &#58;: Cursor
-&gt; [Text]</literal>. For all content nodes, it returns the contained text;
otherwise, it returns an empty list.</simpara>
<simpara>And thanks to the monad instance for lists, it&#8217;s easy to string all of these
together. For example, to do our title lookup, we would write the following
program:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Prelude hiding (readFile)
import Text.XML
import Text.XML.Cursor
import qualified Data.Text as T

main :: IO ()
main = do
    doc &lt;- readFile def "test.xml"
    let cursor = fromDocument doc
    print $ T.concat $
            child cursor &gt;&gt;= element "head" &gt;&gt;= child
                         &gt;&gt;= element "title" &gt;&gt;= descendant &gt;&gt;= content</programlisting>
<simpara>What this says is:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Get me all the child nodes of the root element
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Filter down to only the elements named "head"
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Get all the children of all those head elements
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Filter down to only the elements named "title"
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Get all the descendants of all those title elements. (A descendant is a
  child, or a descendant of a child. Yes, that was a recursive definition.)
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Get only the text nodes.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>So for the input document:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My &lt;b&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Foo bar baz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>We end up with the output <literal>My Title</literal>. This is all well and good, but it&#8217;s much
more verbose than the XPath solution. To combat this verbosity, Aristid
Breitkreuz added a set of operators to the Cursor module to handle many common
cases. So we can rewrite our example as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Prelude hiding (readFile)
import Text.XML
import Text.XML.Cursor
import qualified Data.Text as T

main :: IO ()
main = do
    doc &lt;- readFile def "test.xml"
    let cursor = fromDocument doc
    print $ T.concat $
        cursor $/ element "head" &amp;/ element "title" &amp;// content</programlisting>
<simpara><literal>$/</literal> says to apply the axis on the right to the children of the cursor on the
left. <literal>&amp;/</literal> is almost identical, but is instead used to combine two axes
together. This is a general rule in <literal>Text.XML.Cursor</literal>: operators beginning with
$ directly apply an axis, while &amp; will combine two together. <literal>&amp;//</literal> is
used for applying an axis to all descendants.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s go for a more complex, if more contrived, example. We have a document
that looks like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Headings&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;hgroup&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1 foo&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="foo"&gt;Heading 2 foo&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;hgroup&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1 bar&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="bar"&gt;Heading 2 bar&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>We want to get the content of all the <literal>h1</literal> tags which precede an <literal>h2</literal> tag with
a <literal>class</literal> attribute of "bar". To perform this convoluted lookup, we can write:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Prelude hiding (readFile)
import Text.XML
import Text.XML.Cursor
import qualified Data.Text as T

main :: IO ()
main = do
    doc &lt;- readFile def "test2.xml"
    let cursor = fromDocument doc
    print $ T.concat $
        cursor $// element "h2"
               &gt;=&gt; attributeIs "class" "bar"
               &gt;=&gt; precedingSibling
               &gt;=&gt; element "h1"
               &amp;// content</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s step through that. First we get all h2 elements in the document. (<literal>$//</literal>
gets all descendants of the root element.) Then we filter out only those with
<literal>class=bar</literal>. That <literal>&gt;=&gt;</literal> operator is actually the standard operator from
Control.Monad; yet another advantage of the monad instance of lists.
<literal>precedingSibling</literal> finds all nodes that come before our node <emphasis role="strong">and</emphasis> share the
same parent. (There is also a <literal>preceding</literal> axis which takes all elements earlier
in the tree.) We then take just the <literal>h1</literal> elements, and then grab their content.</simpara>
<note><simpara>The equivalent XPath, for comparison, would be <literal>//h2[@class =
'bar']/preceding-sibling::h1//text()</literal>.</simpara></note>
<simpara>While the cursor API isn&#8217;t quite as succinct as XPath, it has the advantages of
being standard Haskell code, and of type safety.</simpara>

<title>xml-hamlet</title>
<simpara>Thanks to the simplicity of Haskell&#8217;s data type system, creating XML content
with the <literal>Text.XML API</literal> is easy, if a bit verbose. The following code:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.Map (empty)
import           Prelude  hiding (writeFile)
import           Text.XML

main :: IO ()
main =
    writeFile def "test3.xml" $ Document (Prologue [] Nothing []) root []
  where
    root = Element "html" empty
        [ NodeElement $ Element "head" empty
            [ NodeElement $ Element "title" empty
                [ NodeContent "My "
                , NodeElement $ Element "b" empty
                    [ NodeContent "Title"
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        , NodeElement $ Element "body" empty
            [ NodeElement $ Element "p" empty
                [ NodeContent "foo bar baz"
                ]
            ]
        ]</programlisting>
<simpara>produces</simpara>
<screen>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My &lt;b&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;foo bar baz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</screen>
<simpara>This is leaps and bounds easier than having to deal with an imperative,
mutable-value-based API (cough, Java, cough), but it&#8217;s far from pleasant, and
obscures what we&#8217;re really trying to achieve. To simplify things, we have the
xml-hamlet package, which using Quasi-Quotation to allow you to type in your
XML in a natural syntax. For example, the above could be rewritten as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes       #-}
import           Data.Map        (empty)
import           Prelude         hiding (writeFile)
import           Text.Hamlet.XML
import           Text.XML

main :: IO ()
main =
    writeFile def "test3.xml" $ Document (Prologue [] Nothing []) root []
  where
    root = Element "html" empty [xml|
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
        My #
        &lt;b&gt;Title
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;foo bar baz
|]</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s make a few points:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The syntax is almost identical to normal Hamlet, except URL-interpolation
  (@{&#8230;}) has been removed. As such:
</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
No close tags.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Whitespace-sensitive.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
If you want to have whitespace at the end of a line, use a # at the end. At
   the beginning, use a backslash.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
An <literal>xml</literal> interpolation will return a list of <literal>Node</literal>s. So you still need to
  wrap up the output in all the normal <literal>Document</literal> and root <literal>Element</literal>
  constructs.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
There is no support for the special <literal>.class</literal> and <literal>#id</literal> attribute forms.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>And like normal Hamlet, you can use variable interpolation and control
structures. So a slightly more complex example would be:</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}
import Text.XML
import Text.Hamlet.XML
import Prelude hiding (writeFile)
import Data.Text (Text, pack)
import Data.Map (empty)

data Person = Person
    { personName :: Text
    , personAge :: Int
    }

people :: [Person]
people =
    [ Person "Michael" 26
    , Person "Miriam" 25
    , Person "Eliezer" 3
    , Person "Gavriella" 1
    ]

main :: IO ()
main =
    writeFile def "people.xml" $ Document (Prologue [] Nothing []) root []
  where
    root = Element "html" empty [xml|
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Some People
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Some People
    $if null people
        &lt;p&gt;There are no people.
    $else
        &lt;dl&gt;
            $forall person &lt;- people
                ^{personNodes person}
|]

personNodes :: Person -&gt; [Node]
personNodes person = [xml|
&lt;dt&gt;#{personName person}
&lt;dd&gt;#{pack $ show $ personAge person}
|]</programlisting>
<simpara>A few more notes:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The caret-interpolation (&#94;{&#8230;}) takes a list of nodes, and so can easily
  embed other <literal>xml</literal>-quotations.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Unlike Hamlet, hash-interpolations (#{&#8230;}) are not polymorphic, and can
  <emphasis>only</emphasis> accept <literal>Text</literal> values.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section id="xml_xml2html">
<title>xml2html</title>
<simpara>So far in this chapter, our examples have revolved around XHTML. I&#8217;ve done that
so far simply because it is likely to be the most familiar form of XML for most
of our readers. But there&#8217;s an ugly side to all this that we must acknowledge:
not all XHTML will be correct HTML. The following discrepancies exist:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
There are some void tags (e.g., <literal>img</literal>, <literal>br</literal>) in HTML which do not need to
  have close tags, and in fact are not allowed to.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
HTML does not understand self-closing tags, so
  <literal>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;script/&gt;</literal> mean very different
  things.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Combining the previous two points: you are free to self-close void tags,
  though to a browser it won&#8217;t mean anything.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
In order to avoid quirks mode, you should start your HTML documents with a
  <literal>DOCTYPE</literal> statement.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
We do not want the XML declaration <literal>&lt;?xml &#8230;?&gt;</literal> at the top of an HTML
  page.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
We do not want any namespaces used in HTML, while XHTML is fully namespaced.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The contents of <literal>&lt;style&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal> tags should not be
  escaped.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>That&#8217;s where the xml2html package comes into play. It provides a ToHtml
instance for <literal>Node</literal>s, <literal>Document</literal>s and <literal>Element</literal>s. In order to use it,
just import the Text.XML.Xml2Html module.</simpara>
<programlisting language="haskell" linenumbering="unnumbered">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes       #-}
import           Data.Map                        (empty)
import           Text.Blaze.Html                 (toHtml)
import           Text.Blaze.Html.Renderer.String (renderHtml)
import           Text.Hamlet.XML
import           Text.XML
import           Text.XML.Xml2Html               ()

main :: IO ()
main = putStr $ renderHtml $ toHtml $ Document (Prologue [] Nothing []) root []

root :: Element
root = Element "html" empty [xml|
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Test
    &lt;script&gt;if (5 &lt; 6 || 8 &gt; 9) alert("Hello World!");
    &lt;style&gt;body &gt; h1 { color: red }
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!
|]</programlisting>
<simpara>Outputs: (whitespace added)</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;
