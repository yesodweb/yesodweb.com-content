   <para/>
   <para>Many developers cringe at the thought of dealing with XML files. XML has the reputation of
   having a complicated data model, with obfuscated libraries and huge layers of complexity sitting
   between you and your goal. I'd like to posit that a lot of that pain is actually a language and
   library issue, not inherent to XML.</para>
   <para>Once again, Haskell's type system allows us to easily break down the problem to its most basic
   form. The <function>xml-types</function> package neatly deconstructs the XML data model (both a
   streaming and DOM-based approach) into some simple ADTs. Haskell's standard immutable data
   structures make it easier to apply transforms to documents, and a simple set of functions makes
   parsing and rendering a breeze.</para>
   <para>We're going to be covering the <function>xml-conduit</function> package. Under
   the surface, this package uses a lot of the approaches Yesod in general does for high
   performance: <function>blaze-builder</function>, <function>text</function>,
    <function>conduit</function> and <function>attoparsec</function>. But from a
   user perspective, it provides everything from the simplest APIs
    (<literal>readFile</literal>/<literal>writeFile</literal>) through full control of XML event
   streams.</para>
   <para>In addition to <literal>xml-conduit</literal>, there are a few related packages that
   come into play, like <function>xml-hamlet</function> and <function>xml2html</function>. We'll cover both how to use all these packages, and when they should be
   used.</para>

    <title>Types</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Let's take a bottom-up approach to analyzing types. This section will also serve as a primer on
   the XML data model itself, so don't worry if you're not completely familiar with it.</para>
    <para>I think the first place where Haskell really shows its strength is with the
    <function>Name</function> datatype. Many languages (like Java) struggle
   with properly expressing names. The issue is that there are in fact three components to a name:
   its local name, its namespace (optional), and its prefix (also optional). Let's look at some XML
   to explain:</para>
    <programlisting>&lt;no-namespace/&gt;
&lt;no-prefix xmlns="first-namespace" first-attr="value1"/&gt;
&lt;foo:with-prefix xmlns:foo="second-namespace" foo:second-attr="value2"/&gt;</programlisting>
    <para>The first tag has a local name of <literal>no-namespace</literal>, and no
   namespace or prefix. The second tag (local name: <literal>no-prefix</literal>) <emphasis>also</emphasis> has no prefix, but it does have a namespace (<literal>first-namespace</literal>). <literal>first-attr</literal>, however, does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
   inherit that namespace: attribute namespaces must always be explicitly set with a prefix.</para>
    <note>
     <para>Namespaces are almost always URIs of some sort, though there is nothing in any specification
   requiring that it be so.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The third tag has a local name of <literal>with-prefix</literal>, a prefix of
    <literal>foo</literal> and a namespace of <literal>second-namespace</literal>.
   Its attribute has a <literal>second-attr</literal> local name and the same prefix and namespace.
   The <literal>xmlns</literal> and <literal>xmlns:foo</literal> attributes are part of the namespace
   specification, and are not considered attributes of their respective elements.</para>
    <para>So let's review what we need from a name: every name has a local name, and it can optionally
   have a prefix and namespace. Seems like a simple fit for a record type:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">data Name = Name
    { nameLocalName :: Text
    , nameNamespace :: Maybe Text
    , namePrefix :: Maybe Text
    }</programlisting>
    <para>According the the XML namespace standard, two names are considered equivalent if they
   have the same localname and namespace. In other words, the prefix is not important. Therefore,
    <literal>xml-types</literal> defines <literal>Eq</literal> and <literal>Ord</literal> instances that
   ignore the prefix.</para>
    <para>The last class instance worth mentioning is <literal>IsString</literal>. It would be
   very tedious to have to manually type out <literal>Name "p" Nothing Nothing</literal>
   every time we want a paragraph. If you turn on <literal>OverloadedStrings</literal>,
    <literal>"p"</literal> will resolve to that all by itself! In addition, the
    <literal>IsString</literal> instance recognizes something called Clark notation, which allows you
   to prefix the namespace surrounded in curly brackets. In other words:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">"{namespace}element" == Name "element" (Just "namespace") Nothing
"element" == Name "element" Nothing Nothing</programlisting>
    <section>
     <title>The Four Types of Nodes</title>
     <para/>
     <para>XML documents are a tree of nested nodes. There are in fact four different types of nodes
   allowed: elements, content (i.e., text), comments, and processing instructions.</para>
     <note>
      <para>You may not be familiar with that last one, it's less commonly used. It is marked
   up as:<programlisting>&lt;?target data?&gt;</programlisting>There are two
   surprising facts about processing instructions (PIs):<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
         <para>PIs don't have attributes. While often times you'll see processing instructions
     that appear to have attributes, there are in fact no rules about that data of an
     instruction.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
         <para>The <literal>&lt;?xml ...?&gt;</literal> stuff at the beginning of a document is not
     a processing instruction. It is simply the beginning of the document (known as the XML
     declaration), and happens to look an awful lot like a PI. The difference though is that the
      <literal>&lt;?xml ...?&gt;</literal> line will not appear in your parsed content.</para>
        </listitem>
       </itemizedlist>
      </para>
     </note>
     <para>Since processing instructions have two pieces of text associated with them (the target and the
   data), we have a simple data type:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">data Instruction = Instruction
    { instructionTarget :: Text
    , instructionData :: Text
    }</programlisting>
     <para>Comments have no special datatype, since they are just text. But content is an
   interesting one: it could contain either plain text or unresolved entities (e.g.,
    <literal>&amp;copyright-statement;</literal>). <function>xml-types</function> keeps those
   unresolved entities in all the data types in order to completely match the spec. However, in
   practice, it can be very tedious to program against those data types. And in most use cases, an
   unresolved entity is going to end up as an error anyway.</para>
     <para>So the <function>Text.XML</function> module defines its own set
   of datatypes for nodes, elements and documents that removes all unresolved entities. If you need
   to deal with unresolved entities instead, you should use the <function>Text.XML.Unresolved</function> module. From now on, we'll be focusing only on the
    <literal>Text.XML</literal> data types, though they are almost identical to the
    <literal>xml-types</literal> versions.</para>
     <para>Anyway, after that detour: content is just a piece of text, and therefore it too does
   not have a special datatype. The last node type is an element, which contains three pieces of
   information: a name, a list of attributes and a list of children nodes. An attribute has two
   pieces of information: a name and a value. (In <literal>xml-types</literal>, this value could
   contain unresolved entities as well.) So our <literal>Element</literal> is defined as:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">data Element = Element
    { elementName :: Name
    , elementAttributes :: [(Name, Text)]
    , elementNodes :: [Node]
    }</programlisting>
     <para>Which of course begs the question: what does a <literal>Node</literal> look like? This
   is where Haskell really shines: its sum types model the XML data model perfectly.</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">data Node
    = NodeElement Element
    | NodeInstruction Instruction
    | NodeContent Text
    | NodeComment Text</programlisting>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Documents</title>
     <para/>
     <para>So now we have elements and nodes, but what about an entire document? Let's just lay out the
   datatypes:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">data Document = Document
    { documentPrologue :: Prologue
    , documentRoot :: Element
    , documentEpilogue :: [Miscellaneous]
    }

data Prologue = Prologue
    { prologueBefore :: [Miscellaneous]
    , prologueDoctype :: Maybe Doctype
    , prologueAfter :: [Miscellaneous]
    }

data Miscellaneous
    = MiscInstruction Instruction
    | MiscComment Text

data Doctype = Doctype
    { doctypeName :: Text
    , doctypeID :: Maybe ExternalID
    }

data ExternalID
    = SystemID Text
    | PublicID Text Text</programlisting>
     <para>The XML spec says that a document has a single root element
    (<literal>documentRoot</literal>). It also has an optional doctype statement. Before and after
   both the doctype and the root element, you are allowed to have comments and processing
   instructions. (You can also have whitespace, but that is ignored in the parsing.)</para>
     <para>So what's up with the doctype? Well, it specifies the root element of the document, and then
   optional public and system identifiers. These are used to refer to DTD files, which give more
   information about the file (e.g., validation rules, default attributes, entity resolution). Let's
   see some examples:</para>
     <programlisting>&lt;!DOCTYPE root&gt; &lt;!-- no external identifier --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE root SYSTEM "root.dtd"&gt; &lt;!-- a system identifier --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE root PUBLIC "My Root Public Identifier" "root.dtd"&gt; &lt;!-- public identifiers have a system ID as well --&gt;</programlisting>
     <para>And that, my friends, is the entire XML data model. For many parsing purposes, you'll
   be able to simply ignore the entire <literal>Document</literal> datatype and go immediately to the
    <literal>documentRoot</literal>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Events</title>
     <para/>
     <para>In addition to the document API, <literal>xml-types</literal> defines an <function>Event</function> datatype. This can be used for constructing
   streaming tools, which can be much more memory efficient for certain kinds of processing (eg,
   adding an extra attribute to all elements). We will not be covering the streaming API currently,
   though it should look very familiar after analyzing the document API.</para>
     <note>
      <para>You can see an example of the streaming API in the Sphinx case
    study.</para>
     </note>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Text.XML</title>
    <para/>
    <para>The recommended entry point to xml-conduit is the <function>Text.XML</function> module. This module exports all of the datatypes you'll need to
   manipulate XML in a DOM fashion, as well as a number of different approaches for parsing and
   rendering XML content. Let's start with the simple
   ones:<programlisting language="haskell">readFile  :: ParseSettings  -&gt; FilePath -&gt; IO Document
writeFile :: RenderSettings -&gt; FilePath -&gt; Document -&gt; IO ()</programlisting>This
   introduces the <literal>ParseSettings</literal> and <literal>RenderSettings</literal> datatypes. You can use these to modify the behavior of the parser and
   renderer, such as adding character entities and turning on pretty (i.e., indented) output. Both
   these types are instances of the <function>Default</function>
   typeclass, so you can simply use <literal>def</literal> when these need to be supplied.
   That is how we will supply these values through the rest of the chapter; please see the API docs
   for more information.</para>
    <para>It's worth pointing out that in addition to the file-based API, there is also a text- and
   bytestring-based API. The bytestring-powered functions all perform intelligent encoding
   detections, and support UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32, in either big or little endian, with and
   without a Byte-Order Marker (BOM). All output is generated in UTF-8.</para>
    <para>For complex data lookups, we recommend using the higher-level cursors API. The
   standard <literal>Text.XML</literal> API not only forms the basis for that higher level, but is
   also a great API for simple XML transformations and for XML generation. See the synopsis for an
   example.</para>
    <section>
     <title>A note about file paths</title>
     <para/>
     <para>In the type signature above, we have a type <literal>FilePath</literal>. However, <emphasis role="bold">this isn't
     <literal>Prelude.FilePath</literal>
      </emphasis>. The standard <literal>Prelude</literal> defines a type
   synonym <literal>type FilePath = [Char]</literal>. Unfortunately, there are many limitations to
   using such an approach, including confusion of filename character encodings and differences in
   path separators.</para>
     <para>Instead, <literal>xml-conduit</literal> uses the <function>system-filepath</function> package,
   which defines an abstract <literal>FilePath</literal> type. I've personally found this to be a much
   nicer approach to work with. The package is fairly easy to follow, so I won't go into details
   here. But I do want to give a few quick explanations of how to use it:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>Since a <literal>FilePath</literal> is an instance of <literal>IsString</literal>, you can type
    in regular strings and they will be treated properly, as long as the
     <literal>OverloadedStrings</literal> extension is enabled. (I highly recommend enabling it
    anyway, as it makes dealing with <literal>Text</literal> values much more pleasant.)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>If you need to explicitly convert to or from <literal>Prelude</literal>'s
     <literal>FilePath</literal>, you should use the
     <function>encodeString</function> and
     <function>decodeString</function>, respectively. This
    takes into account file path encodings.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>Instead of manually splicing together directory names and file names with extensions, use the
    operators in the <literal>Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS</literal> module, e.g. <literal>myfolder &lt;/&gt;
     filename &lt;.&gt; extension</literal>.</para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Cursor</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Suppose you want to pull the title out of an XHTML document. You could do so with the
    <literal>Text.XML</literal> interface we just described, using standard pattern matching on the
   children of elements. But that would get very tedious, very quickly. Probably the gold standard
   for these kinds of lookups is XPath, where you would be able to write <literal>/html/head/title</literal>. And that's exactly what inspired the design of the <function>Text.XML.Cursor</function> combinators.</para>
    <para>A cursor is an XML node that knows its location in the tree; it's able to traverse
   upwards, sideways, and downwards. (Under the surface, this is achieved by <link href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tying_the_Knot">tying
    the knot</link>.) There are two functions available for creating cursors from
    <literal>Text.XML</literal> types: <literal>fromDocument</literal> and
   <literal>fromNode</literal>.</para>
    <para>We also have the concept of an <glossterm>Axis</glossterm>, defined as <literal>type Axis = Cursor -&gt; [Cursor]</literal>. It's easiest to get started by looking at
   example axes: child returns zero or more cursors that are the child of the current one, parent
   returns the single parent cursor of the input, or an empty list if the input is the root element,
   and so on.</para>
    <para>In addition, there are some axes that take predicates. <literal>element</literal> is a commonly
   used function that filters down to only elements which match the given name. For example,
    <literal>element "title"</literal> will return the input element if its name is "title", or an
   empty list otherwise.</para>
    <para>Another common function which isn't quite an axis is <literal>content :: Cursor -&gt;
    [Text]</literal>. For all content nodes, it returns the contained text; otherwise, it returns an
   empty list.</para>
    <para>And thanks to the monad instance for lists, it's easy to string all of these
   together. For example, to do our title lookup, we would write the following program:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Prelude hiding (readFile)
import Text.XML
import Text.XML.Cursor
import qualified Data.Text as T

main :: IO ()
main = do
    doc &lt;- readFile def "test.xml"
    let cursor = fromDocument doc
    print $ T.concat $
            child cursor &gt;&gt;= element "head" &gt;&gt;= child
                         &gt;&gt;= element "title" &gt;&gt;= descendant &gt;&gt;= content</programlisting>
    <para>What this says is:</para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>Get me all the child nodes of the root element</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Filter down to only the elements named "head"</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Get all the children of all those head elements</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Filter down to only the elements named "title"</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Get all the descendants of all those title elements. (A descendant is a child, or a
    descendant of a child. Yes, that was a recursive definition.)</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Get only the text nodes.</para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>So for the input document:</para>
    <programlisting>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My &lt;b&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Foo bar baz&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>
    <para>We end up with the output <literal>My Title</literal>. This is all well and good, but it's much
   more verbose than the XPath solution. To combat this verbosity, Aristid Breitkreuz added a set of
   operators to the Cursor module to handle many common cases. So we can rewrite our example as:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Prelude hiding (readFile)
import Text.XML
import Text.XML.Cursor
import qualified Data.Text as T

main :: IO ()
main = do
    doc &lt;- readFile def "test.xml"
    let cursor = fromDocument doc
    print $ T.concat $
        cursor $/ element "head" &amp;/ element "title" &amp;// content</programlisting>
    <para>
     <literal>$/</literal> says to apply the axis on the right to the children of
   the cursor on the left. <literal>&amp;/</literal> is almost identical, but is instead
   used to combine two axes together. This is a general rule in <literal>Text.XML.Cursor</literal>: operators beginning with $ directly apply an axis, while &amp; will
   combine two together. <literal>&amp;//</literal> is used for applying an axis to all
   descendants.</para>
    <para>Let's go for a more complex, if more contrived, example. We have a document that looks
   like:</para>
    <programlisting>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Headings&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;hgroup&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1 foo&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="foo"&gt;Heading 2 foo&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
        &lt;hgroup&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Heading 1 bar&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="bar"&gt;Heading 2 bar&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/hgroup&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>
    <para>We want to get the content of all the <literal>h1</literal> tags which precede an
    <literal>h2</literal> tag with a <literal>class</literal> attribute of "bar". To perform this
   convoluted lookup, we can write:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Prelude hiding (readFile)
import Text.XML
import Text.XML.Cursor
import qualified Data.Text as T

main :: IO ()
main = do
    doc &lt;- readFile def "test2.xml"
    let cursor = fromDocument doc
    print $ T.concat $
        cursor $// element "h2"
               &gt;=&gt; attributeIs "class" "bar"
               &gt;=&gt; precedingSibling
               &gt;=&gt; element "h1"
               &amp;// content</programlisting>
    <para>Let's step through that. First we get all h2 elements in the document.
    (<literal>$//</literal> gets all descendants of the root element.) Then we filter out only those
   with <literal>class=bar</literal>. That <literal>&gt;=&gt;</literal> operator is actually
   the standard operator from <function>Control.Monad</function>; yet another advantage
   of the monad instance of lists. <literal>precedingSibling</literal> finds all nodes that come
   before our node <emphasis role="bold">and</emphasis> share the same parent. (There is also a <literal>preceding</literal> axis which takes all elements earlier in the tree.) We then take just the
    <literal>h1</literal> elements, and then grab their content.</para>
    <note>
     <para>The equivalent XPath, for comparison, would be <literal>//h2[@class =
    'bar']/preceding-sibling::h1//text()</literal>.</para>
    </note>
    <para>While the cursor API isn't quite as succinct as XPath, it has the advantages of being standard
   Haskell code, and of type safety.</para>

    <title>xml-hamlet</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Thanks to the simplicity of Haskell's data type system, creating
            XML content with the <literal>Text.XML API</literal> is easy, if a bit verbose. The
            following code:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Text.XML
import Prelude hiding (writeFile)

main :: IO ()
main =
    writeFile def "test3.xml" $ Document (Prologue [] Nothing []) root []
  where
    root = Element "html" []
        [ NodeElement $ Element "head" []
            [ NodeElement $ Element "title" []
                [ NodeContent "My "
                , NodeElement $ Element "b" []
                    [ NodeContent "Title"
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        , NodeElement $ Element "body" []
            [ NodeElement $ Element "p" []
                [ NodeContent "foo bar baz"
                ]
            ]
        ]</programlisting>
    <para>produces</para>
    <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My &lt;b&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;foo bar baz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>
    <para>This is leaps and bounds easier than having to deal with an imperative, mutable-value-based API
   (cough, Java, cough), but it's far from pleasant, and obscures what we're really trying to
   achieve. To simplify things, we have the <function>xml-hamlet</function> package, which using
   Quasi-Quotation to allow you to type in your XML in a natural syntax. For example, the above
   could be rewritten as:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}
import Text.XML
import Text.Hamlet.XML
import Prelude hiding (writeFile)

main :: IO ()
main =
    writeFile def "test3.xml" $ Document (Prologue [] Nothing []) root []
  where
    root = Element "html" [] [xml|
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
        My #
        &lt;b&gt;Title
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;foo bar baz
|]</programlisting>
    <para>Let's make a few points:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>The syntax is almost identical to normal Hamlet, except URL-interpolation (@{...}) has been
    removed. As such:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
         <para>No close tags.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
         <para>Whitespace-sensitive.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
         <para>If you want to have whitespace at the end of a line, use a # at the end. At the beginning,
      use a backslash.</para>
        </listitem>
       </itemizedlist>
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>An <literal>xml</literal> interpolation will return a list of <literal>Node</literal>s. So you still need to wrap up the output in all the normal
                    <literal>Document</literal> and root <literal>Element</literal> constructs.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>There is no support for the special <literal>.class</literal> and
                    <literal>#id</literal> attribute forms.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>And like normal Hamlet, you can use variable interpolation and control structures. So a
   slightly more complex example would be:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}
import Text.XML
import Text.Hamlet.XML
import Prelude hiding (writeFile)
import Data.Text (Text, pack)

data Person = Person
    { personName :: Text
    , personAge :: Int
    }

people :: [Person]
people =
    [ Person "Michael" 26
    , Person "Miriam" 25
    , Person "Eliezer" 3
    , Person "Gavriella" 1
    ]

main :: IO ()
main =
    writeFile def "people.xml" $ Document (Prologue [] Nothing []) root []
  where
    root = Element "html" [] [xml|
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Some People
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Some People
    $if null people
        &lt;p&gt;There are no people.
    $else
        &lt;dl&gt;
            $forall person &lt;- people
                ^{personNodes person}
|]

personNodes :: Person -&gt; [Node]
personNodes person = [xml|
&lt;dt&gt;#{personName person}
&lt;dd&gt;#{pack $ show $ personAge person}
|]</programlisting>
    <para>A few more notes:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>The caret-interpolation (^{...}) takes a list of nodes, and so can easily embed
                other <literal>xml</literal>-quotations.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Unlike Hamlet, hash-interpolations (#{...}) are not polymorphic, and can <emphasis>only</emphasis> accept <literal>Text</literal> values.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <title>xml2html</title>
    <para/>
    <para>So far in this chapter, our examples have revolved around XHTML. I've done that so far
   simply because it is likely to be the most familiar form of XML for most of our readers. But
   there's an ugly side to all this that we must acknowledge: not all XHTML will be correct HTML.
   The following discrepancies exist:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>There are some void tags (e.g., <literal>img</literal>, <literal>br</literal>) in HTML
    which do not need to have close tags, and in fact are not allowed to.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>HTML does not understand self-closing tags, so <literal>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</literal> and
     <literal>&lt;script/&gt;</literal> mean very different things.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Combining the previous two points: you are free to self-close void tags, though to a browser
    it won't mean anything.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>In order to avoid quirks mode, you should start your HTML documents with a
     <literal>DOCTYPE</literal> statement.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>We do not want the XML declaration <literal>&lt;?xml ...?&gt;</literal> at the top of an HTML
    page</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>We do not want any namespaces used in HTML, while XHTML is fully namespaced.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>The contents of <literal>&lt;style&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal>
    tags should not be escaped.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>That's where the <function>xml2html</function> package comes into play. It provides a
    <function>ToHtml</function> instance for <literal>Node</literal>s,
    <literal>Document</literal>s and <literal>Element</literal>s. In order to use it, just import the
    <function>Text.XML.Xml2Html</function> module.</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings, QuasiQuotes #-}
import Text.Blaze (toHtml)
