            need to deal with is between the application and the storage layer. Whether it be a SQL
            database, a YAML file, or a binary blob, odds are you have to work to get your storage
            layer to accept your application datatypes. Persistent is Yesod's answer to data
            storage- a type-safe, universal data store interface for Haskell. </p><p id="112-i1.5">Haskell has many different database bindings available. However, most of these have
            little knowledge of a schema and therefore do not provide useful static guarantees. They
            also force database-dependent APIs and data types on the programmer. Haskellers have
            attempted a more revolutionary route of creating Haskell specific data stores to get
            around these flaws that allow one to easily store any Haskell type. These options are
            great for certain use cases, but they constrain one to the storage techniques provided
            by the library, do not interface well with other languages, and the flexibility can also
            mean one must write reams of code for querying data. In contrast, Persistent allows us
            to choose among existing databases that are highly tuned for different data storage use
            cases, interoperate with other programming languages, and to use a safe and productive
            query interface. </p><p id="112-i2">Persistent follows the guiding principles of type safety and concise, declarative syntax. Some other nice features are:</p><ul id="112-x1"><li id="112-x2">Database-agnostic. There is first class support for PostgreSQL, SQLite and MongoDB, with
                experimental CouchDB and MySQL support in the works.</li><li id="112-x3">By being non-relational in nature, we simultaneously are able to support a wider number of storage layers and are not constrained by some of the performance bottlenecks incurred through joins.</li><li id="112-x4">A major source of frustration in dealing with SQL databases is changes to the schema. Persistent can automatically perform database migrations.</li></ul>

            something like:</p><codeblock outputclass="sql" id="114-x1">CREATE TABLE Person(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, age INTEGER)</codeblock><p id="114-b2">And if you are using a database like PostgreSQL, you can be guaranteed that the database will never store some arbitrary text in your age field. (The same cannot be said of SQLite, but let's forget about that for now.) To mirror this database table, you would likely create a Haskell datatype that looks something like:</p><codeblock id="114-x2" outputclass="haskell">data Person = Person
    { personName :: Text
    , personAge :: Int
    }</codeblock><p id="114-b3">It looks like everything is type safe: the database schema matches our Haskell datatypes, the database ensures that invalid data can never make it into our data store, and everything is generally awesome. Well, until:</p><ul id="114-x3"><li id="114-x4">You want to pull data from the database, and the database layer gives you the data in an untyped format.</li><li id="114-x5">You want to find everyone older than 32, and you accidently write "thirtytwo" in your SQL statement. Guess what: that will compile just fine, and you won't find out you have a problem until runtime.</li><li id="114-x6">You decide you want to find the first 10 people alphabetically. No problem... until you
                make a typo in your SQL. Once again, you don't find out until runtime.</li></ul><p id="114-b4">In dynamic languages, the answer to these issues is unit testing. For everything that <i id="114-x7">can</i> go wrong, make sure you write a test case. But as I am sure you are aware by now, that doesn't jive well with the Yesod approach to things. We like to take advantage of Haskell's strong typing to save us wherever possible, and data storage is no exception.</p><p id="114-b5">So the question remains: how can we use Haskell's type system to save the day?</p></conbody><concept id="types-115"><title>Types</title><conbody><p id="115-ba1">Like routing, there is nothing intrinsically difficult about type-safe data access. It
            just requires a lot of monotonous, error prone, boiler plate code. As usual, this means
            we can use the type system to keep us honest. And to avoid some of the drudgery, we'll
            use a sprinkling of Template Haskell.</p>
<note id="115-x1">Earlier versions of Persistent made much heavier usage of Template Haskell. Starting
            with 0.6, there is a new architecture inspired by the <apiname id="115-x2">groundhog</apiname>
            package. This approach uses phantom types to carry a lot of the burden.</note>
<p id="115-ba2"><codeph id="115-x3">PersistValue</codeph> is the basic building block of Persistent. It is a
            sum type that can represent data that gets sent to and from a database. Its definition
            is:</p><codeblock id="115-x4" outputclass="haskell">data PersistValue = PersistText Text

            something the database can understand. However, it would be awkward do have to express
            all of our data simply in terms of these basic types. The next layer is the <codeph id="115-x5">PersistField</codeph> typeclass, which defines how an arbitrary Haskell
            datatype can be marshaled to and from a <codeph id="115-x6">PersistValue</codeph>. A
                <codeph id="115-x-3">PersistField</codeph> correlates to a column in a SQL database. In our

            SQL database. This typeclass defines a number of functions and some associated types. To
            review, we have the following correspondence between Persistent and SQL:</p>

                <apiname id="116-x10">persistent-template:Database.Persist.TH:mkPersist</apiname> takes that list

        <p id="125-x-3">Querying is only half the battle. We also need to be able to add data to and modify
            existing data in the database.</p>
    </conbody><concept id="insert-126"><title>Insert</title><conbody>  <p id="126-x1">It's all well and good to be able to play with data in the database, but how does it
   get there in the first place? The answer is the <codeph id="126-x-3">insert</codeph> function. You just give
   it a value, and it gives back an ID.</p>
  <p id="126-x2">At this point, it makes sense to explain a bit of the philosophy behind Persistent. In
   many other ORM solutions, the datatypes used to hold data are opaque: you need to go through
   their defined interfaces to get at and modify the data. That's not the case with Persistent:
   we're using plain old Algebraic Data Types for the whole thing. This means you still get all the
   great benefits of pattern matching, currying and everything else you're used to.</p>
  <p id="126-x3">However, there are a few things we <i id="126-x4">can't</i> do. For one, there's no way to automatically
   update values in the database every time the record is updated in Haskell. Of course, with
   Haskell's normal stance of purity and immutability, this wouldn't make much sense anyway, so I
   don't shed any tears over it.</p>
  <p id="126-x5">However, there is one issue that newcomers are often bothered by: why are IDs and values
   completely separate? It seems like it would be very logical to embed the ID inside the value. In
   other words, instead of
   having:<codeblock outputclass="haskell" id="126-x6">data Person = Person { name :: String }</codeblock>have<codeblock outputclass="haskell" id="126-x7">data Person = Person { personId :: PersonId, name :: String }</codeblock></p>
  <p id="126-x8">Well, there's one problem with this right off the bat: how do we do an
    <codeph id="126-x-4">insert</codeph>? If a Person needs to have an ID, and we get the ID by inserting, and an
   insert needs a Person, we have an impossible loop. We could solve this with
    <codeph id="126-x-5">undefined</codeph>, but that's just asking for trouble.</p>
  <p id="126-x9">OK, you say, let's try something a bit
   safer:<codeblock outputclass="haskell" id="126-x10">data Person = Person { personId :: Maybe PersonId, name :: String }</codeblock>I
   definitely prefer <codeph id="126-x11">insert $ Person Nothing "Michael"</codeph> to <codeph id="126-x12">insert $ Person undefined "Michael"</codeph>. And now our types will be much simpler, right?
   For example, <codeph id="126-x-6">selectList</codeph> could return a simple <codeph id="126-x13">[Person]</codeph>
   instead of that ugly <codeph id="126-x14">[Entity SqlPersist Person]</codeph>.</p>
  <note id="126-x-7"><codeph id="126-x-8">Entity</codeph> is a datatype that ties together both the ID and value of an entity.
   Since IDs can be different based on backend, we also need to provide the Persistent backend we're
   using. The datatype <codeph id="126-x-9">Entity SqlPersist Person</codeph> can be read as "the ID and value of
   a person stored in a SQL database."</note>
  <p id="126-x15">The problem is that the "ugliness" is incredibly useful. Having <codeph id="126-x16">Entity SqlPersist Person</codeph> makes it obvious, at the type level, that we're dealing with
   a value that exists in the database. Let's say we want to create a link to another page that
   requires the <codeph id="126-x17">PersonId</codeph> (not an uncommon occurrence as we'll discuss
   later). The <codeph id="126-x-10">Entity SqlPersist Person</codeph> form gives us unambiguous access to that
   information; embedding <codeph id="126-x-11">PersonId</codeph> within <codeph id="126-x-12">Person</codeph> with a
    <codeph id="126-x-13">Maybe</codeph> wrapper means an extra runtime check for <codeph id="126-x-14">Just</codeph>, instead
   of a more error-proof compile time check.</p>
  <p id="126-x18">Finally, there's a semantic mismatch with embedding the ID within the value. The
    <codeph id="126-x-15">Person</codeph> is the value. Two people are identical (in the context of a
   database) if all their fields are the same. By embedding the ID in the value, we're no longer
   talking about a person, but about a row in the database. Equality is no longer really equality,
   it's identity: is this the <i id="126-x19">same person</i>, as opposed to an equivalent person.</p>
  <p id="126-x20">In other words, there are some annoyances with having the ID separated out, but overall, it's
   the <i id="126-x21">right</i> approach, which in the grand scheme of things leads to better, less buggy
   code.</p>
 </conbody></concept><concept id="update-127"><title>Update</title><conbody>  <p id="127-x1">Now, in the context of that discussion, let's think about updating. The simplest way to

  <p id="131-x1">So far, we've spoken about <codeph id="131-x-3">Person</codeph> and <codeph id="131-x-4">PersonId</codeph>
   without really explaining what they are. In the simplest sense, for a SQL-only system, the
    <codeph id="131-x-5">PersonId</codeph> could just be <codeph id="131-x2">type PersonId = Int64</codeph>. However,
   that means there is nothing binding a <codeph id="131-x-6">PersonId</codeph> at the type level to the
    <codeph id="131-x-7">Person</codeph> entity. As a result, you could accidently use a
    <codeph id="131-x-8">PersonId</codeph> and get a <codeph id="131-x-9">Car</codeph>. In order to model this relationship,
   we use phantom types. So, our next naive step would be:</p>
  <codeblock id="131-x3" outputclass="haskell">newtype Key entity = Key Int64
type PersonId = Key Person</codeblock>
  <note id="131-x4">Prior to Persistent 0.6, we used associated types instead of phantom types. You could solve
   the problem in that direction as well, but phantoms worked out better.</note>
  <p id="131-x5">And that works out really well, until you get to a backend that doesn't use Int64 for
   its IDs. And that's not just a theoretical question; MongoDB uses <codeph id="131-x-10">ByteString</codeph>s
   instead. So what we need is a key value that can contain an <codeph id="131-x-11">Int</codeph> and a
    <codeph id="131-x-12">ByteString</codeph>. Seems like a great time for a sum type:</p>
  <codeblock id="131-x6" outputclass="haskell">data Key entity = KeyInt Int64 | KeyByteString ByteString</codeblock>
  <p id="131-x7">But that's just asking for trouble. Next we'll have a backend that uses timestamps, so
   we'll need to add another constructor to <codeph id="131-x-13">Key</codeph>. This could go on for a while.
   Fortunately, we already have a sum type intended for representing arbitrary data:
    <codeph id="131-x-14">PersistValue</codeph>:</p>
  <codeblock outputclass="haskell" id="131-x8">newtype Key entity = Key PersistValue</codeblock>
  <p id="131-x9">But this has another problem. Let's say we have a web application that takes an ID as a
   parameter from the user. It will need to receive that parameter as <codeph id="131-x-15">Text</codeph> and then
   try to convert it to a <codeph id="131-x-16">Key</codeph>. Well, that's simple: write a function to convert a
    <codeph id="131-x-17">Text</codeph> to a <codeph id="131-x-18">PersistValue</codeph>, and then wrap the result in the
    <codeph id="131-x-19">Key</codeph> constructor, right?</p>
  <p id="131-x10">Wrong. We tried this, and there's a big problem. We end up getting
    <codeph id="131-x-20">Key</codeph>s that could never be. For example, if we're dealing with SQL, a key must be
   an integer. But the approach described above would allow arbitrary textual data in. The result
   was a bunch of 500 server errors as the database choked on comparing an integer column to
   text.</p>
  <p id="131-x11">So what we need is a way to convert text to a <codeph id="131-x-21">Key</codeph>, but have it
   dependent on the rules of the backend in question. And once phrased that way, the answer is
   simple: just add another phantom. The real, actual definition of <codeph id="131-x-22">Key</codeph> in
   Persistent is:</p>
  <codeblock id="131-x12" outputclass="haskell">newtype Key backend entity = Key { unKey :: PersistValue }</codeblock>
  <p id="131-x13">This works great: we can have a <codeph id="131-x14">Text -&gt; Key MongoDB entity</codeph> function and a
    <codeph id="131-x15">Text -&gt; Key SqlPersist entity</codeph> function, and everything runs smoothly. But now
   we have a new problem: relations. Let's say we want to represent blogs and blog posts. We would
   use the entity definition:</p>
  <codeblock outputclass="entities" id="131-x16">Blog
    title Text
Post
    title Text
    blogId BlogId</codeblock>
  <p id="131-x17">But what would that look like in terms of our <codeph id="131-x-23">Key</codeph> datatype?</p>
  <codeblock id="131-x18" outputclass="haskell">data Blog = Blog { blogTitle :: Text }
data Post = Post { postTitle :: Text, postBlogId :: Key &lt;what goes here?&gt; Blog }</codeblock>
  <p id="131-x19">We need something to fill in as the backend. In theory, we could hardcode this to
    <codeph id="131-x-24">SqlPersist</codeph>, or <codeph id="131-x-25">Mongo</codeph>, but then our datatypes will only work
   for a single backend. For an individual application, that might be acceptable, but what about
   libraries defining datatypes to be used by multiple applications, using multiple backends?</p>
  <p id="131-x20">So things got a little more complicated. Our types are actually:</p>
  <codeblock id="131-x21" outputclass="haskell">data BlogGeneric backend = Blog { blogTitle :: Text }
data PostGeneric backend = Post { postTitle :: Text, postBlogId :: Key backend (BlogGeneric backend) }</codeblock>
  <p id="131-x22">Notice that we still keep the short names for the constructors and the records. Finally, to
   give a simple interface for normal code, we define some type synonyms:</p>
  <codeblock outputclass="haskell" id="131-x23">type Blog = BlogGeneric SqlPersist
type BlogId = Key SqlPersist Blog
type Post = PostGeneric SqlPersist
type PostId = Key SqlPersist Post</codeblock>
  <p id="131-x24">And no, <codeph id="131-x-26">SqlPersist</codeph> isn't hard-coded into Persistent anywhere. That
    <codeph id="131-x-27">sqlSettings</codeph> parameter you've been passing to <codeph id="131-x-28">mkPersist</codeph> is what
   tells us to use <codeph id="131-x-29">SqlPersist</codeph>. Mongo code will use <codeph id="131-x-30">mongoSettings</codeph>
   instead.</p>
  <p id="131-x25">This might be quite complicated under the surface, but user code hardly ever touches
   this. Look back through this whole chapter: not once did we need to deal with the
    <codeph id="131-x-31">Key</codeph> or <codeph id="131-x-32">Generic</codeph> stuff directly. The most common place for it to
   pop up is in compiler error messages. So it's important to be aware that this exists, but it
   shouldn't affect you on a day-to-day basis.</p>

            backend-agnostic, such as not relying on relational features of SQL. My experience has
            been you can easily perform 95% of what you need to do with the high-level interface.
            (In fact, most of my web apps use the high level interface exclusively.)</p>
  <p id="133-x2">But occassionally you'll want to use a feature that's specific to a backend. One feature I've
   used in the past is full text search. In this case, we'll use the SQL "LIKE" operator, which is
   not modeled in Persistent. We'll get all people with the last name "Snoyman" and print the
   records out.</p>
        <note id="133-x4">Actually, you <i id="133-x5">can</i> express a LIKE operator directly in the
            normal syntax due to a feature added in Persistent 0.6, which allows backend-specific

  <p id="134-x5">There are two important pieces here for general use. <codeph id="134-x-5">runDB</codeph> is used to

                <codeph id="134-x-7">runDB</codeph>, you can use any of the functions we've spoken about so far,
            such as <codeph id="134-x-8">insert</codeph> and <codeph id="134-x-9">selectList</codeph>.</p>

  <p id="134-x6">The other new feature is <codeph id="134-x-10">get404</codeph>. It works just like
