   <para>Forms deal with the boundary between the user and the application. Another boundary we
            need to deal with is between the application and the storage layer. Whether it be a SQL
            database, a YAML file, or a binary blob, odds are you have to work to get your storage
            layer to accept your application datatypes. Persistent is Yesod's answer to data
            storage- a type-safe, universal data store interface for Haskell. </para>
   <para>Haskell has many different database bindings available. However, most of these have
            little knowledge of a schema and therefore do not provide useful static guarantees. They
            also force database-dependent APIs and data types on the programmer. Haskellers have
            attempted a more revolutionary route of creating Haskell specific data stores to get
            around these flaws that allow one to easily store any Haskell type. These options are
            great for certain use cases, but they constrain one to the storage techniques provided
            by the library, do not interface well with other languages, and the flexibility can also
            mean one must write reams of code for querying data. In contrast, Persistent allows us
            to choose among existing databases that are highly tuned for different data storage use
            cases, interoperate with other programming languages, and to use a safe and productive
            query interface. </para>
   <para>Persistent follows the guiding principles of type safety and concise, declarative syntax. Some other nice features are:</para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>Database-agnostic. There is first class support for PostgreSQL, SQLite and MongoDB, with
                experimental CouchDB and MySQL support in the works.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>By being non-relational in nature, we simultaneously are able to support a wider number of storage layers and are not constrained by some of the performance bottlenecks incurred through joins.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>A major source of frustration in dealing with SQL databases is changes to the schema. Persistent can automatically perform database migrations.</para>

    <title>Solving the boundary issue</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Suppose you are storing information on people in a SQL database. Your table might look
            something like:</para>
    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE Person(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, age INTEGER)</programlisting>
    <para>And if you are using a database like PostgreSQL, you can be guaranteed that the database will never store some arbitrary text in your age field. (The same cannot be said of SQLite, but let's forget about that for now.) To mirror this database table, you would likely create a Haskell datatype that looks something like:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">data Person = Person
    { personName :: Text
    , personAge :: Int
    }</programlisting>
    <para>It looks like everything is type safe: the database schema matches our Haskell datatypes, the database ensures that invalid data can never make it into our data store, and everything is generally awesome. Well, until:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>You want to pull data from the database, and the database layer gives you the data in an untyped format.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>You want to find everyone older than 32, and you accidently write "thirtytwo" in your SQL statement. Guess what: that will compile just fine, and you won't find out you have a problem until runtime.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>You decide you want to find the first 10 people alphabetically. No problem... until you
                make a typo in your SQL. Once again, you don't find out until runtime.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>In dynamic languages, the answers to these issues is unit testing. For everything that <emphasis>can</emphasis> go wrong, make sure you write a test case. But as I am sure you are aware by now, that doesn't jive well with the Yesod approach to things. We like to take advantage of Haskell's strong typing to save us wherever possible, and data storage is no exception.</para>
    <para>So the question remains: how can we use Haskell's type system to save the day?</para>
    <section>
     <title>Types</title>
     <para/>
     <para>Like routing, there is nothing intrinsically difficult about type-safe data access. It
            just requires a lot of monotonous, error prone, boiler plate code. As usual, this means
            we can use the type system to keep us honest. And to avoid some of the drudgery, we'll
            use a sprinkling of Template Haskell.</para>
     <note>
      <para>Earlier versions of Persistent made much heavier usage of Template Haskell. Starting
            with 0.6, there is a new architecture inspired by the <function>groundhog</function>
            package. This approach uses phantom types to carry a lot of the burden.</para>
     </note>
     <para>
      <literal>PersistValue</literal> is the basic building block of Persistent. It is a
            sum type that can represent data that gets sent to and from a database. Its definition
            is:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">data PersistValue = PersistText Text
                  | PersistByteString ByteString
                  | PersistInt64 Int64
                  | PersistDouble Double
                  | PersistBool Bool
                  | PersistDay Day
                  | PersistTimeOfDay TimeOfDay
                  | PersistUTCTime UTCTime
                  | PersistNull
                  | PersistList [PersistValue]
                  | PersistMap [(T.Text, PersistValue)]
                  | PersistForeignKey ByteString -- ^ intended especially for MongoDB backend</programlisting>
     <para>Each Persistent backend needs to know how to translate the relevant values into
            something the database can understand. However, it would be awkward do have to express
            all of our data simply in terms of these basic types. The next layer is the <literal>PersistField</literal> typeclass, which defines how an arbitrary Haskell
            datatype can be marshaled to and from a <literal>PersistValue</literal>. A
                <literal>PersistField</literal> correlates to a column in a SQL database. In our
            person example above, name and age would be our <literal>PersistField</literal>s.</para>
     <para>To tie up the user side of the code, our last typeclass is <literal>PersistEntity</literal>. An instance of PersistEntity correlates with a table in a
            SQL database. This typeclass defines a number of functions and some associated types. To
            review, we have the following correspondence between Persistent and SQL:</para>

     </table>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Code Generation</title>
     <para/>
     <para>In order to ensure that the PersistEntity instances match up properly with your Haskell datatypes, Persistent takes responsibility for both. This is also good from a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourslef) perspective: you only need to define your entities once. Let's see a quick example:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes, TypeFamilies, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, TemplateHaskell, OverloadedStrings, GADTs #-}
import Database.Persist
import Database.Persist.TH
import Database.Persist.Sqlite
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)

mkPersist sqlSettings [persist|
Person
    name String
    age Int
    deriving Show
|]
</programlisting>
     <para>We use a combination of Template Haskell and Quasi-Quotation (like when defining
            routes): <function>persist</function> is a
            quasi-quoter which converts a whitespace-sensitive syntax into a list of entity
            definitions. (You can also declare your entities in a separate file using
                <function>persistFile</function>.)
                <function>mkPersist</function> takes that list
            of entities and declares:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>One Haskell datatype for each entity.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>A <literal>PersistEntity</literal> instance for each datatype defined.</para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     <para>The example above generates code that looks like the following:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, OverloadedStrings, GADTs #-}
import Database.Persist
import Database.Persist.Store
import Database.Persist.Sqlite
import Database.Persist.EntityDef

    { personName :: String
    , personAge :: Int
    }
  deriving (Show, Read, Eq)

type PersonId = Key SqlPersist Person

instance PersistEntity Person where
    -- A Generalized Algebraic Datatype (GADT).
    -- This gives us a type-safe approach to matching fields with
    -- their datatypes.
    data EntityField Person typ where
        PersonId   :: EntityField Person PersonId
        PersonName :: EntityField Person String
        PersonAge  :: EntityField Person Int

    type PersistEntityBackend Person = SqlPersist

    toPersistFields (Person name age) =
        [ SomePersistField name
        , SomePersistField age
        ]

    fromPersistValues [nameValue, ageValue] = Person
        &lt;$&gt; fromPersistValue nameValue
        &lt;*&gt; fromPersistValue ageValue
    fromPersistValues _ = Left "Invalid fromPersistValues input"

    -- Information on each field, used internally to generate SQL statements
    persistFieldDef PersonId = FieldDef
        (HaskellName "Id")
        (DBName "id")
        (FTTypeCon Nothing "PersonId")
        []
    persistFieldDef PersonName = FieldDef
        (HaskellName "name")
        (DBName "name")
        (FTTypeCon Nothing "String")
        []
    persistFieldDef PersonAge = FieldDef
        (HaskellName "age")
        (DBName "age")
        (FTTypeCon Nothing "Int")
        []
</programlisting>
     <para>As you might expect, our <literal>Person</literal> datatype closely matches the definition
            we gave in the original Template Haskell version. We also have a Generalized Algebraic
            Datatype (GADT) which gives a separate constructor for each field. This GADT encodes
            both the type of the entity and the type of the field. We use its constructors
            throughout Persistent, such as to ensure that when we apply a filter, the types of the
            filtering value match the field.</para>
     <para>We can use the generated <literal>Person</literal> type like any other Haskell type, and
            then pass it off to other Persistent functions.</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">main = withSqliteConn ":memory:" $ runSqlConn $ do
    michaelId &lt;- insert $ Person "Michael" 26
    michael &lt;- get michaelId
    liftIO $ print michael
</programlisting>
     <para>We start off with some standard database connection code. In this case, we used the single-connection functions. Persistent also comes built in with connection pool functions, which we will generally want to use in production.</para>
     <para>In this example, we have seen two functions: <literal>insert</literal> creates a new
            record in the database and returns its ID. Like everything else in Persistent, IDs are
            type safe. We'll get into more details of how these IDs work later. So when you call
                <literal>insert $ Person "Michael" 25</literal>, it gives you a value back of
            type <literal>PersonId</literal>.</para>
     <para>The next function we see is <literal>get</literal>, which attempts to load a value from
            the database using an <literal>Id</literal>. In Persistent, you never need to
            worry that you are using the key from the wrong table: trying to load up a different
            entity (like <literal>House</literal>) using a <literal>PersonId</literal> will
            never compile.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>PersistStore</title>
     <para/>
     <para>One last detail is left unexplained from the previous example: what are those
                <literal>withSqliteConn</literal> and <literal>runSqlConn</literal> functions doing, and
            what is that monad that our database actions are running in?</para>
     <para>All database actions need to occur within an instance of <literal>PersistStore</literal>. As its name implies, every data store (PostgreSQL, SQLite,
            MongoDB) has an instance of <literal>PersistStore</literal>. This is where all the
            translations from <literal>PersistValue</literal> to database-specific values
            occur, where SQL query generation happens, and so on.</para>
     <note>
      <para>As you can imagine, even though <literal>PersistStore</literal> provides a safe,
                well-typed interface to the outside world, there are a lot of database interactions
                that could go wrong. However, by testing this code automatically and thoroughly in a
                single location, we can centralize our error-prone code and make sure it is as
                bug-free as possible.</para>
     </note>
     <para>
      <literal>withSqliteConn</literal> creates a single connection to a database using its
            supplied connection string. For our test cases, we will use <literal>:memory:</literal>,
            which uses an in-memory database. <literal>runSqlConn</literal> uses that connection to
            run the inner action. Both SQLite and PostgreSQL share the same instance of
                <literal>PersistStore</literal>: <literal>SqlPersist</literal>.</para>
     <note>
      <para>There are actually a few other typeclasses: <literal>PersistUpdate</literal> and
                <literal>PersistQuery</literal>. Different typeclasses provide different
            functionality, which allows us to write backends that use simpler data stores (e.g.,
            Redis) even though they can't provide us all the high-level functionality available in
            Persistent.</para>
     </note>
     <para>One important thing to note is that everything which occurs inside a single call to
                <literal>runSqlConn</literal> runs in a single transaction. This has two important
            implications:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>For many databases, committing a transaction can be a costly activity. By putting multiple steps into a single transaction, you can speed up code dramatically.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>If an exception is thrown anywhere inside a single call to <literal>runSqlConn</literal>,
                all actions will be rolled back (assuming your backend has rollback support).</para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Migrations</title>
    <para/>
    <para>I'm sorry to tell you, but so far I have lied to you a bit: the example from the previous section does not actually work. If you try to run it, you will get an error message about a missing table.</para>
    <para>For SQL databases, one of the major pains can be managing schema changes. Instead of leaving this to the user, Persistent steps in to help, but you have to <emphasis>ask</emphasis> it to help. Let's see what this looks like:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes, TypeFamilies, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, TemplateHaskell,
             OverloadedStrings, GADTs, FlexibleContexts #-}
import Database.Persist
import Database.Persist.TH

import Control.Monad.IO.Class (liftIO)

share [mkPersist sqlSettings, mkSave "entityDefs"] [persist|

    age Int
    deriving Show
|]

main = withSqliteConn ":memory:" $ runSqlConn $ do
    runMigration $ migrate entityDefs (undefined :: Person) -- this line added: that's it!
    michaelId &lt;- insert $ Person "Michael" 26
    michael &lt;- get michaelId
    liftIO $ print michael
</programlisting>
    <para>With this one little code change, Persistent will automatically create your
                <literal>Person</literal> table for you. This split between
                <literal>runMigration</literal> and <literal>migrate</literal> allows you to migrate
            multiple tables simultaneously.</para>
    <para>This works when dealing with just a few entities, but can quickly get tiresome once we
            are dealing with a dozen entities. Instead of repeating yourself, Persistent provides a
            helper function, <literal>mkMigrate</literal>:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes, TypeFamilies, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, TemplateHaskell,

|]

main = withSqliteConn ":memory:" $ runSqlConn $ do
    runMigration migrateAll
</programlisting>
    <para>
     <literal>mkMigrate</literal> is a Template Haskell function which creates a new function
            that will automatically call <literal>migrate</literal> on all entities defined in the
                <literal>persist</literal> block. The <literal>share</literal> function is just a little
            helper that passes the information from the persist block to each Template Haskell
            function and concatenates the results.</para>
    <para>Persistent has very conservative rules about what it will do during a migration. It
            starts by loading up table information from the database, complete with all defined SQL
            datatypes. It then compares that against the entity definition given in the code. For
            the following cases, it will automatically alter the schema:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>The datatype of a field changed. However, the database may object to this modification if the data cannot be translated.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>A field was added. However, if the field is not null, no default value is supplied (we'll discuss defaults later) and there is already data in the database, the database will not allow this to happen.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>A field is converted from not null to null. In the opposite case, Persistent will attempt the conversion, contingent upon the database's approval.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>A brand new entity is added.</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>However, there are some cases that Persistent will not handle:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>Field or entity renames: Persistent has no way of knowing that "name" has now been renamed to "fullName": all it sees is an old field called name and a new field called fullName.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>Field removals: since this can result in data loss, Persistent by default will refuse
                to perform the action (you can force the issue by using
                    <literal>runMigrationUnsafe</literal> instead of <literal>runMigration</literal>,
                though it is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> recommended).</para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     <literal>runMigration</literal> will print out the migrations it is running on
                <literal>stderr</literal> (you can bypass this by using
                <literal>runMigrationSilent</literal>). Whenever possible, it uses <literal>ALTER
                TABLE</literal> calls. However, in SQLite, <literal>ALTER TABLE</literal> has very
            limited abilities, and therefore Persistent must resort to copying the data from one
            table to another.</para>
    <para>Finally, if instead of <emphasis>performing</emphasis> a migration, you want Persistent to
            give you hints about what migrations are necessary, use the
                <literal>printMigration</literal> function. This function will print out the
            migrations which <literal>runMigration</literal> would perform for you. This may be useful
            for performing migrations that Persistent is not capable of, for adding arbitrary SQL to
            a migration, or just to log what migrations occurred.</para>

   <section>
    <title>Uniqueness</title>
    <para/>
    <para>In addition to declaring fields within an entity, you can also declare uniqueness
            constraints. A typical example would be requiring that a username be unique.</para>

    <para>To declare a unique combination of fields, we add an extra line to our declaration. Persistent knows that it is defining a unique constructor, since the line begins with a capital letter. Each following word must be a field in this entity.</para>
    <para>The main restriction on uniqueness is that it can only be applied non-null fields. The
            reason for this is that the SQL standard is ambiguous on how uniqueness should be
            applied to <literal>NULL</literal> (e.g., is <literal>NULL=NULL</literal> true or false?).
            Besides that ambiguity, most SQL engines in fact implement rules which would be <emphasis>contrary</emphasis> to what the Haskell datatypes anticipate (e.g., PostgreSQL says
            that <literal>NULL=NULL</literal> is false, whereas Haskell says <literal>Nothing ==
                Nothing</literal> is <literal>True</literal>).</para>
    <para>In addition to providing nice guarantees at the database level about consistency
            of your data, uniqueness constraints can also be used to perform some specific queries
            within your Haskell code, like the <literal>getBy</literal> demonstrated above.
            This happens via the <literal>Unique</literal> associated type. In the example
            above, we end up with a new constructor:</para>

    <title>Queries</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Depending on what your goal is, there are different approaches to querying the database.
            Some commands query based on a numeric ID, while others will filter. Queries also differ
            in the number of results they return: some lookups should return no more than one result
            (if the lookup key is unique) while others can return many results.</para>
    <para>Persistent therefore provides a few different query functions. As usual, we try to encode
            as many invariants in the types as possible. For example, a query that can return only 0
            or 1 results will use a <literal>Maybe</literal> wrapper, whereas a query returning many
            results will return a list.</para>
    <section>
     <title>Fetching by ID</title>
     <para/>
     <para>The simplest query you can perform in Persistent is getting based on an ID. Since this
   value may or may not exist, its return type is wrapped in a <literal>Maybe</literal>.</para>

     <para>This can be very useful for sites that provide URLs like <filename>/person/5</filename>. However, in such a case, we don't usually care about the

   helps us out here. We'll go into more details when we see integration with Yesod.</para>

   over a certain age; all cars available in blue; all users without a registered email address. For

     <para>All the select functions use a similar interface, with slightly different outputs:</para>

     </table>
     <para>
      <literal>selectList</literal> is the most commonly used, so we will cover it
   specifically. Understanding the others should be trivial after that.</para>
     <para>
      <literal>selectList</literal> takes two arguments: a list of <literal>Filter</literal>s,
   and a list of <literal>SelectOpt</literal>s. The former is what limits your results based on
   characteristics; it allows for equals, less than, is member of, and such.
    <literal>SelectOpt</literal>s provides for three different features: sorting, limiting output to a
   certain number of rows, and offsetting results by a certain number of rows.</para>
     <note>
      <para>The combination of limits and offsets is very important; it allows for efficient
   pagination in your webapps.</para>
     </note>
     <para>Let's jump straight into an example of filtering, and then analyze it.</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">    people &lt;- selectList [PersonAge &gt;. 25, PersonAge &lt;=. 30] []
    liftIO $ print people
</programlisting>
     <para>As simple as that example is, we really need to cover three points:</para>
     <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>PersonAge</literal> is a constructor for an associated phantom type. That
    might sound scary, but what's important is that it uniquely identifies the "age" column of the
    "person" table, and that it knows that the age field is an <literal>Int</literal>. (That's the
    phantom part.)</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>We have a bunch of Persistent filtering operators. They're all pretty straight-forward: just
    tack a period to the end of what you'd expect. There are three gotchas here, I'll explain
    below.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>The list of filters is ANDed together, so that our constraint means "age is greater than 25
    AND age is less than or equal to 30". We'll describe ORing later.</para>
      </listitem>
     </orderedlist>
     <para>The one operator that's surprisingly named is "not equals." We use
    <literal>!=.</literal>, since <literal>/=.</literal> is used for updates (for "divide-and-set",
   described later). Don't worry: if you use the wrong one, the compiler will catch you. The other
   two surprising operators are the "is member" and "is not member". They are, respectively, <literal>&lt;-.</literal> and <literal>/&lt;-.</literal> (both end with a period).</para>
     <para>And regarding ORs, we use the <literal>||.</literal> operator. For example:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">    people &lt;- selectList
        (       [PersonAge &gt;. 25, PersonAge &lt;=. 30]
            ||. [PersonFirstName /&lt;-. ["Adam", "Bonny"]]
            ||. ([PersonAge ==. 50] ||. [PersonAge ==. 60])
        )
        []
    liftIO $ print people
</programlisting>
     <para>This (completely nonsensical) example means: find people who are 26-30, inclusive, OR whose
   names are neither Adam or Bonny, OR whose age is either 50 or 60.</para>
     <section>
      <title>SelectOpt</title>
      <para/>
      <para>All of our <literal>selectList</literal> calls have included an empty list as the second
   parameter. That specifies no options, meaning: sort however the database wants, return all
   results, and don't skip any results. A <literal>SelectOpt</literal> has four constructors that can
   be used to change all that.</para>
      <variablelist>
       <varlistentry>
        <term>Asc</term>
        <listitem>
         <para>Sort by the given column in ascending order. This uses the same phantom type as
     filtering, such as <literal>PersonAge</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
        <term>Desc</term>
        <listitem>
         <para>Same as <literal>Asc</literal>, in descending order.</para>
        </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
        <term>LimitTo</term>
        <listitem>
         <para>Takes an <literal>Int</literal> argument. Only return up to the specified number of
     results.</para>
        </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
        <term>OffsetBy</term>
        <listitem>
         <para>Takes an <literal>Int</literal> argument. Skip the specified number of results.</para>
        </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>The following code defines a function that will break down results into pages. It returns all
   people aged 18 and over, and then sorts them by age (oldest person first). For people with the
   same age, they are sorted alphabetically by last name, then first name.</para>
      <programlisting language="haskell">resultsForPage pageNumber = do
    let resultsPerPage = 10
    selectList
        [ PersonAge &gt;=. 18
        ]
        [ Desc PersonAge
        , Asc PersonLastName
        , Asc PersonFirstName
        , LimitTo resultsPerPage
        , OffsetBy $ (pageNumber - 1) * resultsPerPage
        ]
</programlisting>
     </section>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Manipulation</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Querying is only half the battle. We also need to be able to add data to and modify
            existing data in the database.</para>
    <section>
     <title>Insert</title>
     <para/>
     <para>It's all well and good to be able to play with data in the database, but how does it
   get there in the first place? The answer is the <literal>insert</literal> function. You just give
   it a value, and it gives back an ID.</para>
     <para>At this point, it makes sense to explain a bit of the philosophy behind Persistent. In
   many other ORM solutions, the datatypes used to hold data are opaque: you need to go through
   their defined interfaces to get at and modify the data. That's not the case with Persistent:
   we're using plain old Algebraic Data Types for the whole thing. This means you still get all the
   great benefits of pattern matching, currying and everything else you're used to.</para>
     <para>However, there are a few things we <emphasis>can't</emphasis> do. For one, there's no way to automatically
   update values in the database every time the record is updated in Haskell. Of course, with
   Haskell's normal stance of purity and immutability, this wouldn't make much sense anyway, so I
   don't shed any tears over it.</para>
     <para>However, there is one issue that newcomers are often bothered by: why are IDs and values
   completely separate? It seems like it would be very logical to embed the ID inside the value. In
   other words, instead of
   having:<programlisting language="haskell">data Person = Person { name :: String }</programlisting>have<programlisting language="haskell">data Person = Person { personId :: PersonId, name :: String }</programlisting>
     </para>
     <para>Well, there's one problem with this right off the bat: how do we do an
    <literal>insert</literal>? If a Person needs to have an ID, and we get the ID by inserting, and an
   insert needs a Person, we have an impossible loop. We could solve this with
    <literal>undefined</literal>, but that's just asking for trouble.</para>
     <para>OK, you say, let's try something a bit
   safer:<programlisting language="haskell">data Person = Person { personId :: Maybe PersonId, name :: String }</programlisting>I
   definitely prefer <literal>insert $ Person Nothing "Michael"</literal> to <literal>insert $ Person undefined "Michael"</literal>. And now our types will be much simpler, right?
   For example, <literal>selectList</literal> could return a simple <literal>[Person]</literal>
   instead of that ugly <literal>[Entity SqlPersist Person]</literal>.</para>
     <note>
      <para>
       <literal>Entity</literal> is a datatype that ties together both the ID and value of an entity.
   Since IDs can be different based on backend, we also need to provide the Persistent backend we're
   using. The datatype <literal>Entity SqlPersist Person</literal> can be read as "the ID and value of
   a person stored in a SQL database."</para>
     </note>
     <para>The problem is that the "ugliness" is incredibly useful. Having <literal>Entity SqlPersist Person</literal> makes it obvious, at the type level, that we're dealing with
   a value that exists in the database. Let's say we want to create a link to another page that
   requires the <literal>PersonId</literal> (not an uncommon occurrence as we'll discuss
   later). The <literal>Entity SqlPersist Person</literal> form gives us unambiguous access to that
   information; embedding <literal>PersonId</literal> within <literal>Person</literal> with a
    <literal>Maybe</literal> wrapper means an extra runtime check for <literal>Just</literal>, instead
   of a more error-proof compile time check.</para>
     <para>Finally, there's a semantic mismatch with embedding the ID within the value. The
    <literal>Person</literal> is the value. Two people are identical (in the context of a
   database) if all their fields are the same. By embedding the ID in the value, we're no longer
   talking about a person, but about a row in the database. Equality is no longer really equality,
   it's identity: is this the <emphasis>same person</emphasis>, as opposed to an equivalent person.</para>
     <para>In other words, there are some annoyances with having the ID separated out, but overall, it's
   the <emphasis>right</emphasis> approach, which in the grand scheme of things leads to better, less buggy
   code.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Update</title>
     <para/>
     <para>Now, in the context of that discussion, let's think about updating. The simplest way to
            update
            is:<programlisting language="haskell">let michael = Person "Michael" 26
    michaelAfterBirthday = michael { personAge = 27 }</programlisting>But
            that's not actually updating anything, it's just creating a new <literal>Person</literal>
            value based on the old one. When we say update, we're <emphasis>not</emphasis> talking about
            modifications to the values in Haskell. (We better not be of course, since Haskell data
            types are immutable.)</para>
     <para>Instead, we're looking at ways of modifying rows in a table. And the simplest way to do
            that is with the <literal>update</literal> function.</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">    personId &lt;- insert $ Person "Michael" "Snoyman" 26
    update personId [PersonAge =. 27]
</programlisting>
     <para>
      <literal>update</literal> takes two arguments: an ID, and a list of <literal>Update</literal>s. The simplest update is assignment, but it's not always
            the best. What if you want to increase someone's age by 1, but you don't have their
            current age? Persistent has you covered:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">haveBirthday personId = update personId [PersonAge +=. 1]
</programlisting>
     <para>And as you might expect, we have all the basic mathematical operators:
                <literal>+=.</literal>, <literal>-=.</literal>, <literal>*=.</literal>, and
                <literal>/=.</literal> (full stop). These can be convenient for updating a single
            record, but they are also essential for proper ACID guarantees. Imagine the alternative:
            pull out a <literal>Person</literal>, increment the age, and update the new value. If you
            have two threads/processes working on this database at the same time, you're in for a
            world of hurt (hint: race conditions).</para>
     <para>Sometimes you'll want to update many fields at once (give all your employees a 5% pay
            increase, for example). <literal>updateWhere</literal> takes two parameters: a list of
            filters, and a list of updates to apply.</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">    updateWhere [PersonFirstName ==. "Michael"] [PersonAge *=. 2] -- it's been a long day
</programlisting>
     <para>Occassionally, you'll just want to completely replace the value in a database with a
            different value. For that, you use (surprise) the <literal>replace</literal> function.</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">    personId &lt;- insert $ Person "Michael" "Snoyman" 26
    replace personId $ Person "John" "Doe" 20
</programlisting>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Delete</title>
     <para/>
     <para>As much as it pains us, sometimes we must part with our data. To do so, we have three
   functions:</para>
     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>delete</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>Delete based on an ID</para>

       <term>deleteWhere</term>

     <programlisting language="haskell">    personId &lt;- insert $ Person "Michael" "Snoyman" 26
    delete personId
    deleteBy $ UniqueName "Michael" "Snoyman"
    deleteWhere [PersonFirstName ==. "Michael"]
</programlisting>
     <para>We can even use deleteWhere to wipe out all the records in a table, we just need to give some
   hints to GHC as to what table we're interested in:</para>
     <programlisting language="haskell">    deleteWhere ([] :: [Filter Person])
</programlisting>

   <section>
    <title>Attributes</title>
    <para/>
    <para>So far, we have seen a basic syntax for our <literal>persist</literal> blocks: a line
            for the name of our entities, and then an indented line for each field with two words:
            the name of the field and the datatype of the field. Persistent handles more than this:
            you can assign an arbitrary list of attributes after the first two words on a line.</para>
    <para>Suppose we want to have a <literal>Person</literal> entity with an (optional) age and
            the timestamp of when he/she was added to the system. For entities already in the
            database, we want to just use the current date-time for that timestamp.</para>

    <para/>
    <para>Persistent allows references between your data types in a manner that is consistent with
            supporting non-SQL databases. We do this by embedding an ID in the related entity. So if
            a person has many cars:</para>

    bruce &lt;- insert $ Person "Bruce Wayne"

    cars &lt;- selectList [CarOwnerId ==. bruce] []

    <para>Using this technique, you can define one-to-many relationships. To define many-to-many
            relationships, we need a join entity, which has a one-to-many relationship with each of
            the original tables. It is also a good idea to use uniqueness constraints on these. For
            example, to model a situation where we want to track which people have shopped in which

    <title>Closer look at types</title>
    <para/>
    <para>So far, we've spoken about <literal>Person</literal> and <literal>PersonId</literal>
   without really explaining what they are. In the simplest sense, for a SQL-only system, the
    <literal>PersonId</literal> could just be <literal>type PersonId = Int64</literal>. However,
   that means there is nothing binding a <literal>PersonId</literal> at the type level to the
    <literal>Person</literal> entity. As a result, you could accidently use a
    <literal>PersonId</literal> and get a <literal>Car</literal>. In order to model this relationship,
   we use phantom types. So, our next naive step would be:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">newtype Key entity = Key Int64
type PersonId = Key Person</programlisting>
    <note>
     <para>Prior to Persistent 0.6, we used associated types instead of phantom types. You could solve
   the problem in that direction as well, but phantoms worked out better.</para>
    </note>
    <para>And that works out really well, until you get to a backend that doesn't use Int64 for
   its IDs. And that's not just a theoretical question; MongoDB uses <literal>ByteString</literal>s
   instead. So what we need is a key value that can contain an <literal>Int</literal> and a
    <literal>ByteString</literal>. Seems like a great time for a sum type:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">data Key entity = KeyInt Int64 | KeyByteString ByteString</programlisting>
    <para>But that's just asking for trouble. Next we'll have a backend that uses timestamps, so
   we'll need to add another constructor to <literal>Key</literal>. This could go on for a while.
   Fortunately, we already have a sum type intended for representing arbitrary data:
    <literal>PersistValue</literal>:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">newtype Key entity = Key PersistValue</programlisting>
    <para>But this has another problem. Let's say we have a web application that takes an ID as a
   parameter from the user. It will need to receive that parameter as <literal>Text</literal> and then
   try to convert it to a <literal>Key</literal>. Well, that's simple: write a function to convert a
    <literal>Text</literal> to a <literal>PersistValue</literal>, and then wrap the result in the
    <literal>Key</literal> constructor, right?</para>
    <para>Wrong. We tried this, and there's a big problem. We end up getting
    <literal>Key</literal>s that could never be. For example, if we're dealing with SQL, a key must be
   an integer. But the approach described above would allow arbitrary textual data in. The result
   was a bunch of 500 server errors as the database choked on comparing an integer column to
   text.</para>
    <para>So what we need is a way to convert text to a <literal>Key</literal>, but have it
   dependent on the rules of the backend in question. And once phrased that way, the answer is
   simple: just add another phantom. The real, actual definition of <literal>Key</literal> in
   Persistent is:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">newtype Key backend entity = Key { unKey :: PersistValue }</programlisting>
    <para>This works great: we can have a <literal>Text -&gt; Key MongoDB entity</literal> function and a
    <literal>Text -&gt; Key SqlPersist entity</literal> function, and everything runs smoothly. But now
   we have a new problem: relations. Let's say we want to represent blogs and blog posts. We would
   use the entity definition:</para>
    <programlisting>Blog
    title Text
Post
    title Text
    blogId BlogId</programlisting>
    <para>But what would that look like in terms of our <literal>Key</literal> datatype?</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">data Blog = Blog { blogTitle :: Text }
data Post = Post { postTitle :: Text, postBlogId :: Key &lt;what goes here?&gt; Blog }</programlisting>
    <para>We need something to fill in as the backend. In theory, we could hardcode this to
    <literal>SqlPersist</literal>, or <literal>Mongo</literal>, but then our datatypes will only work
   for a single backend. For an individual application, that might be acceptable, but what about
   libraries defining datatypes to be used by multiple applications, using multiple backends?</para>
    <para>So things got a little more complicated. Our types are actually:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">data BlogGeneric backend = Blog { blogTitle :: Text }
data PostGeneric backend = Post { postTitle :: Text, postBlogId :: Key backend (BlogGeneric backend) }</programlisting>
    <para>Notice that we still keep the short names for the constructors and the records. Finally, to
   give a simple interface for normal code, we define some type synonyms:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">type Blog = BlogGeneric SqlPersist
type BlogId = Key SqlPersist Blog
type Post = PostGeneric SqlPersist
type PostId = Key SqlPersist Post</programlisting>
    <para>And no, <literal>SqlPersist</literal> isn't hard-coded into Persistent anywhere. That
    <literal>sqlSettings</literal> parameter you've been passing to <literal>mkPersist</literal> is what
   tells us to use <literal>SqlPersist</literal>. Mongo code will use <literal>mongoSettings</literal>
   instead.</para>
    <para>This might be quite complicated under the surface, but user code hardly ever touches
   this. Look back through this whole chapter: not once did we need to deal with the
    <literal>Key</literal> or <literal>Generic</literal> stuff directly. The most common place for it to
   pop up is in compiler error messages. So it's important to be aware that this exists, but it
   shouldn't affect you on a day-to-day basis.</para>

   <section>
    <title>Custom Fields</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Occassionally, you will want to define a custom field to be used in your datastore. The most common case is an enumeration, such as employment status. For this, Persistent provides a helper Template Haskell function:</para>
    <programlisting language="haskell">{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes, TypeFamilies, GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, TemplateHaskell,
             OverloadedStrings, GADTs, FlexibleContexts #-}
import Database.Persist

import Database.Persist.TH

data Employment = Employed | Unemployed | Retired
    deriving (Show, Read, Eq)
derivePersistField "Employment"

share [mkPersist sqlSettings, mkMigrate "migrateAll"] [persist|
Person
    name String
    employment Employment
|]

main = withSqliteConn ":memory:" $ runSqlConn $ do
    runMigration migrateAll

    insert $ Person "Bruce Wayne" Retired
    insert $ Person "Peter Parker" Unemployed
    insert $ Person "Michael" Employed
</programlisting>
    <para>
     <literal>derivePersistField</literal> stores the data in the database using a string
            field, and performs marshaling using the <literal>Show</literal> and <literal>Read</literal>
            instances of the datatype. This may not be as efficient as storing via an integer, but
            it is much more future proof: even if you add extra constructors in the future, your
            data will still be valid.</para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Persistent: Raw SQL</title>
    <para/>
    <para>The Persistent package provides a type safe interface to data stores. It tries to be
            backend-agnostic, such as not relying on relational features of SQL. My experience has
            been you can easily perform 95% of what you need to do with the high-level interface.
            (In fact, most of my web apps use the high level interface exclusively.)</para>
    <para>But occassionally you'll want to use a feature that's specific to a backend. One feature I've
   used in the past is full text search. In this case, we'll use the SQL "LIKE" operator, which is
   not modeled in Persistent. We'll get all people with the last name "Snoyman" and print the
   records out.</para>
    <note>
     <para>Actually, you <emphasis>can</emphasis> express a LIKE operator directly in the
            normal syntax due to a feature added in Persistent 0.6, which allows backend-specific
            operators. But this is still a good example, so let's roll with it.</para>

    <title>Integration with Yesod</title>

    <para>So you've been convinced of the power of Persistent. How do you integrate it with your
            Yesod application? If you use the scaffolding, most of the work is done for you already.
            But as we normally do, we'll build up everything manually here to point out how it works
            under the surface.</para>
    <para>The <function>yesod-persistent</function> package provides the meeting point
            between Persistent and Yesod. It provides the <literal>YesodPersist</literal>
            typeclass, which standardizes access to the database via the <literal>runDB</literal> method. Let's see this in action.</para>

    <para>There are two important pieces here for general use. <literal>runDB</literal> is used to
            run a DB action from within a <literal>Handler</literal>. Within the
                <literal>runDB</literal>, you can use any of the functions we've spoken about so far,
            such as <literal>insert</literal> and <literal>selectList</literal>.</para>
    <note>
     <para>The type of <literal>runDB</literal> is <literal>runDB :: YesodDB sub master a -&gt; GHandler
                sub master a</literal>. <literal>YesodDB</literal> is defined
            as:<programlisting language="haskell">type YesodDB sub master = YesodPersistBackend master (GHandler sub master)</programlisting>Since
            it is built on top of the <literal>YesodPersistBackend</literal> associated type, it uses
            the appropriate database backend based on the current site.</para>
    </note>
    <para>The other new feature is <literal>get404</literal>. It works just like
                <literal>get</literal>, but instead of returning a <literal>Nothing</literal> when a
            result can't be found, it returns a 404 message page. The <literal>getPersonR</literal>
            function is a very common approach used in real-world Yesod applications:
                <literal>get404</literal> a value and then return a response based on it.</para>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <para/>
    <para>Persistent brings the type safety of Haskell to your data access layer. Instead of writing
   error-prone, untyped data access, or manually writing boilerplate marshal code, you can rely on
   Persistent to automate the process for you.</para>
    <para>The goal is to provide everything you need, <emphasis>most</emphasis> of the time. For the times when you
   need something a bit more powerful, Persistent gives you direct access to the underlying data
   store, so you can write whatever 5-way joins you want.</para>
    <para>Persistent integrates directly into the general Yesod workflow. Not only do helper packages
   like <literal>yesod-persistent</literal> provide a nice layer, but packages like
    <literal>yesod-form</literal> and <literal>yesod-auth</literal> also leverage Persistent's features
   as well.</para>
